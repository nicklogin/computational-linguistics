The\nnight is fast approaching as the weak autumn sun drifts behind the distant horizon. Ablaze\nthroughout the near-night sky are the magnificent colors one can only see outside the city of\nWaterdeep. Streaks of silver, purple, pink, olive and blue intersect with one another, forming\nmore strikingly, beautiful colors that make up dusk sky.\n\nUp ahead, you make out the hunched forms of several dark figures. If it were daylight, you could\ndetermine their appearance, however, the approaching night only displays their shadowy\nsilhouettes. As you draw closer, you take notice their are six of them, all surrounding something\nand flailing about wildly. The once sweet scent of fall is now replaced by the horrid stench of\nbrimstone and freshly disturbed soil. No noise escapes the trees save the wailing wind and\nrustling leaves.\n\nWithin seconds, the six dark figures stop flailing, and turn to your direction. With a jerky gait,\nthey make their way towards your party. It is then you hear the unearthly, inhuman sounds of\nblood-filled gurgling from the shadow-covered group. Stepping from the shadows of the trees it\nsoon becomes apparent that these figures may have been at one time human, but have now been\nhorribly changed.\n\nClad in dirty, half-rotten drabs of clothing, they slightly resemble peasants in dress, but that is\nwere the similarity ends. Patches of hair cover the scalps of each deranged-looking creature.\nTheir pace quickens at the sight of your group, their long, spear-like tongues covered with fresh\nblood flit about like snakes. Several have on their bodies, a series of slashes and cuts, though no\nblood flows from their wounds only insects and dirt. Their dirty claws reach out to rend your\nflesh as they open a mouth full of sharp, rotten teeth and let out another horrid, gurgling sound\nthat expels spittle's of crimson.\n\nDM: This pack of ghouls is all that is left of a once larger group, that attacked Roark Dillihnon,\nthe ranger in the previous encounter. At the time of Roark's attack, the ghouls numbered 12, but\nhave since been reduced to half that when they attacked a group of adventurers. The remains of\nthe adventurers lie just beyond the trees, where they are all but completely devoured. Unless\neach of the two bodies that have not been devoured our blessed by a priest, they rise up in 1d4+3\nrounds and attack the characters*.\nGhouls (6): CR 1; Medium-Size Undead; HD 2d12; hp 12, 11, 10, 7, 6x2; Init +2 (+2 Dexterity);\nSpd 30 ft.; AC 14 (+4 Natural); Atk +3/+0/+0 melee ( 1d6+1, bite; 1d3, 2 claws); SA Paralysis,\ncreate spawn; SQ Undead, +2 turn resistance; AL CE; SV Fort +0, Ref +2, Will +5; Str 12, Dex\n15, Con --, Int 13, Chr 16.\n\nSkills and Feats: Climb +6, Escape Artist +7, Hide +7, Intuit Direction +3, Jump +6, Move\nSilently +7, Search +6, Spot +8; Multiattack, Weapon Finesse (bite).\n\nSpecial Attacks: Paralysis (Ex): Those hit by a bite or claw must make a Fortitude save (DC 14)\nor be paralyzed for 1d6+2 rounds; elves are immune.\n\n\n\nSpecial Attacks: Create Spawn (Ex): Unless a victim slain by a ghoul is not enspelled with\nprotection from evil on his/her body, they will themselves turn into ghouls.\n\nSpecial Qualities: Undead: Immune to mind-influencing effects, poison, sleep, paralyzation,\nstunning, and disease; not subject to critical hits, ability damage, subdual damage, ability drain,\nenergy drain, or death from massive damage.\n\n*DM's Note: Only add this to the encounter if you wish to make it harder on the PCs. The\nfollowing should be done, if the PCs do not cast protection from evil the corpses of the\nadventurers, use the ghoul statistics in the above text.\n\nDM: Anyone searching the remains of the former adventurers discovers the following treasure in\nthe area where the adventurers were attacked by the ghouls: six small road-worn leather belt\npouches containing 2d12 dantars (gp) each, 2d8 tarans (sp) each, and a total of two gems (table\ncut frost agate, worth 12 gp; an inch-thick ring fashioned out of angelar's skin, accented by a\nthin-platinum wire, spiraling around its band; 100 gp value), a triangular +1 large steel shield\n(emblazoned with two crossed silver swords with gold hilts and ruby encrusted pommels; the\nherald of an unknown and long-forgotten mercenary company in Amn), a thick, leather bound\ntome, clasped with a bronze buckle (spellbook containing all 0-level spells, 14 1st-level spells, 5\n2nd-level spells of the DMs discretion), a +2 dagger of returning and a platinum-chained, ivory-\nencrusted cameo necklace of a regal lord wearing an exquisitely-detailed, plumed helm (actually\nan amulet of inescapable location). The PCs also find standard, mundane equipment typically\ncarried by adventurers (rations, normal weapons, rope, torches, etc.etc...). Most of their\nequipment is torn, shredded and unusable.\n\nDue to the rancid stench and horrific scene, should any PCs search the surrounding area they are\nrequired to make a successful Fortitude save (DC 15), or become both sick (vomiting) and ill\n(extreme nausea) for 2-5 (1d4+1) rounds thereafter, suffering a -2 to Strength and Dexterity. This\nwill continue until either the PC leaves the area or the allotted time passes, which requires an\nadditional three rounds to subside, or unless the PCs leave the affected area (30-ft. radius from\nthe bodies).\n\nThe six bodies were part of a company of low-level adventurers, the Men of the One True Hand.\nAll where either sympathizers or dedicated worshippers of Torm Truehand, God of Duty. They\nhailed from far-off Amn, and were lead by a paladin of Torm, Ermforth Trueheart (LG hm Pal2).\nThe group also consisted of Woalter of Cape Velen (NG hm Ftr2), Gellyessth (N hem Wzd2),\nFirsn of Torm (LG hm Clr2), Qolin Hurriedfoot (NG halfm Rog3), and Haeltor Dalloveg (CG\nhm Ftr2). The company formed in the Year of the Banner (1368 DR, 336 NR) in Athkatla. They\nhave since adventured up along the Sword Coast, where they will, \"the spread the will of the\nTorm, and put to practice his Penance of Duty to help all those suffering from the Arrival.\"\n\nAnyone burying the fallen adventurers will be awarded a bonus of no more than 250 XP, and\nanyone blessing the bodies shall receive an additional 100 XP for their goodly act.\n\nCreated by Jessie Pyles < Dimestorehoodlum@aol.com>\n\nmailto:Dimestorehoodlum@aol.com\n\n", "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA Nightly Visitor\n\n\nA Nightly Visitor\n\nNear a swamp or marsh (Vast Swamp - East of Cormyr)\nPCs - Level 1+\n\nMheoow is a hungry, lonely mongrelman who is the only survivor of a small clan of mongrelmen that lived in\nthe Vast Swamp. His home was attacked by lizard men, and he survived only because he had to relieve himself\nand was not in the hut when the attack happened.\n He was terrified and hid himself in the bushes. When the lizard men had left, he walked away from the ruins of\nhis home and from the Vast Swamp. However, he has not been able to find any real food beside some roots and\nberries.\nHe is now quite hungry and willing to try and steal whatever he can. When he spotted the group of wanderers, he\nfigured them to be suitable targets. He waits until night falls, then he will sneak into the camp and take any food\nhe can manage. He has met humans before and knows that humans are dangerous. He will not try to talk to\nanyone, afraid of being killed or enslaved.\n\nMheoow has a lot of a cat in his blood, and he has some skill at moving silently (40%) and hiding in shadows\n(55%). If the adventurers has a guard, it is very likely that Mheoow will be detected and captured. If he is not\ndetected or they have no guard, he will steal whatever food he finds and can carry and then flee away to a\ntemporary hideout.\nHis hidout is camouflaged and only 20% detectable at ranges closer than 50 feet. Any character with the tracking\nproficiency can follow Mheoows tracks, and should notice that the creature they are tracking leaves a right print\nof a human left print of a paw. The adventurers should be able to find Mheoows hideout.\n\nIt is when Mheoow has been captured that the real encounter starts.\nMheoow looks like a human with many cat-like features. His left hand and foot are cat paws, and he is dressed in\nfilthy rags and a tattered cloak. He has a rusty long sword strapped to his back, and he will try to use the sword\nin self-defence. Any character who looks at Mheoows sword swinging will notice that Mheoow is not very\nskilled with the sword.\nMheoow will surrender immediately if given the option. If the adventurers just try to kill him, he will drop his\nsword and plead for mercy.\n\nHere the Dm has an opportunity to play upon the players feelings, tell them how hungry he is and that there\nwas no great harm to them (no matter if he took all their rations). Test their alignments, and test their patience\nwith Mheoow´s whining and bootlicking. Mheoow has no pride and his only priority is to survive.\n\nIf the adventurers ask about Mheoow´s past, he will tell them of the lizard men that attacked his home and killed\nhis family.\nThis encounter can easily lead into another adventure in the Vast Swamp, if the adventurers wants to seek for the\nlizard men camp.\n\n\n", "\nThe Accursed Tower Conversion Guide\nConverted By: Boone Pollard\nFor comments e-mail me at \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\tHello, this is my first conversion so e-mail me at  to tell me what you think  and to give me any suggestions.. I am a huge fan of R. A. Salvatore’s Drizzt Do’Urden books so I was very excited to download The Accursed Tower and try it out. Much to my dismay it was 2nd edition AD&D and my campaign was 3rd Edition D&D so I took it upon myself to convert it to 3rd edition. I also included Drizzt Do’Urden’s stats as can be found at the Wizards of the Coast Website, ,  they can be found at the end of this supplement.  The only thing I had to convert was the NPCs and the Monsters. So here they are!\n\t NOTE you will still need The Accursed Tower Module. You can download it for $3.49 at  It is not my intention to rip off Wizards of the Coast so you will still need to buy their module to use any of this, unless of course you want to put them in your own adventure.

He is completely amoral and will do anything that\nfurthers his own ends.\nHistory: While researching spells for the late Dendy-\nbar the Mottled, Celerum came across excerpts from\nthe diary of Damien Morienus. The diary contained\nreferences to some type of potion of great power but\nfailed to describe the process of making it. Intrigued,\nCelerum delved deeper into the archives of the Host-\ntower, eventually discovering that Damien had a re-\nsearch tower somewhere in Icewind Dale. He also dis-\ncovered that Damien, a former master of the North\nSpire himself, was actually working on a recipe for lich-\ndom but had not completed it before he mysteriously\ndisappeared with his tower. The towers disappearance\nalso coincided with a period of the Dales history called\nthe Great Thaw. Finding no further reference to\nDamien, Celerum decided to search for himself.\nCelerum traveled throughout Icewind Dale with a\nfriendly merchant, Boswell C. Peddywinkle. Peddywin-\nkle had been traveling to the Dale for years, trading in\nthe valuable scrimshaw, and who had an impressive\nnetwork already set up for fishing on the lakes. Seeing\nthis as an opportunity too good to pass up, Celerum\nkilled Peddywinkle along the road and, using his hat of\ndisguise, has assumed the merchants identity.\nMerchant Persona: Boswell C. Peddywinkle\nDescription: Boswell is 5 4ls and quite pudgy, with a\nregal look to him. He is around 50 years old, with a\ngreat handlebar mustache and bright blue eyes. He has\nvery little hair left and what is there is pure white. He is\ndressed in rich courtly dress.\nPersonality: Peddywinkle is very friendly, outgoing,\nand talkative. He delights in the telling of fanciful sto-\nries about his exploits such as when he acquired a very\nrare bauble that was a gift from the beautiful queen of\nSalsa, who, by the way, was quite smitten with him.\nLong-term goal: Peddywinkle/Celerum wants\nDamiens diary. If the PCs prevent him from getting it,\ntelligent monsters, or thieves) either to get the book if\nthe PCs have it or for revenge if they destroyed it (or\notherwise kept it from him). If the PCs foil his plan,\ntheyll earn themselves a long-term foe in Celerum,\nand perhaps all of the forces of the Hosttower of\nLuskan.\n\nRumblebelly’s Stats \n(Regis’ Stats)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nfor those of you who don’t know Rumblebelly is Bruenor’s nickname for Regis.\n\nRegis, halfling male R7: AC 16 (leather, Dex); MV 12; hp\n35; ATK +3; #AT 1; Dmg by weapon; SZ S (3); ML\nelite (13) AL NG.\nSpecial Equipment: +2 luck stone, ruby pendant of be-\nguiling (acts as a rod of beguiling), and a mace +2.\nS 10, D 17, C 15, I 13, W 15, C 15.\nDescription: Regis is barely 3’ tall with curly brown\nhair and a belly that hangs far over his belt.\nSkills: Pickpocket 10,  Move Silently 12, Hide 16\n Personality: Regis is good-natured though lazy, and\nnot malicious in the least.

Ranger spells he typically has prepared include: 1st--animal friendship, entangle, pass without trace; 2nd--detect evil, hold animal, protection from elements; 3rd --control plants, neutralize poison; 4th--nondetection.\nSpecial: As a ranger, Drizzt gains a bonus to Bluff, Listen, Spot, and Track, as well as damage rolls against the following types of creatures: goblinoids (+4), magical beasts (+3), evil outsiders (+2), and vermin (+1). As a drow, he can use the following spell-like abilities, each once per day, as a sorcerer of his level: dancing lights, faerie fire, and darkness. He has darkvision and +2 to saving throws against spells and spell-like effects; he’s lost his normal spell resistance, as he’s been on the surface too long.\nLanguages: Drizzt speaks Common, Elven, Dwarven, and Undercommon (the language of the Underdark).\nPossessions: mithral chain mail +4, a frostbrand +3 scimitar (named Icingdeath), a defender +5 scimitar (named Twinkle), and a figurine of wondrous power, an onyx panther named Guenhwyvar (see the end of this entry for more information). Drizzt carries a mix of adventuring gear, including some drow and dwarven equipment.\nAppearance: Somewhat larger than a typical dark elf, Drizzt stands 5’4\" and weighs about 130 lbs. His handsome features are sharp and well proportioned; his white hair is long, flowing, and smooth. His violet eyes are windows to his passionate soul. He normally wears a fur-collared forest-green cloak and high black boots. It has been more than 70 years since he first ventured into the surface world and at present he is in the neighborhood of 140 years old—still a young adult by elven standards.\nBackground: It would be impossible to recount all of Drizzt's legendary adventures (described in a series of novels by R. A. Salvatore, see Sources). The major events of his life are described here.\nDrizzt was born into the ninth house of Menzoberranzan, called Daermon N’a’shezbaernon, more commonly known as Do’Urden, on the night when that house wiped out one of its rivals. As a male in the matriarchal society of the drow, Drizzt was trained by his father, Zaknafein, to be a warrior.\nDrizzt was first dienchanted and then disgusted by the corrupt, vicious nature of drow culture. He sought some means of escape. In the meantime, his family came to realize his abhorrent (to them) principles, and his father, the house’s Weapons Master, gave his life to save his son when the family’s matriarch wanted Drizzt executed as a traitor.\nThe path of Drizzt’s life took an irrevocable turn away from the evil ways of his kind when he killed Masoj Hun’ett, a drow who had been using a figurine of wondrous power for tawdry assassinations and other detestable work. In the magical panther named Guenhwyvar, Drizzt sensed a kindred spirit -- a fierce but brave and loyal warrior trapped in the drow’s dark world of deceit. Drizzt liberated Guen from Hun’ett, and later fled Menzoberranzan entirely.\nHe and Guen wandered the Underdark for a decade, always moving, until they found a grotto tended by the fungus people known as the myconids. While there was life here, Drizzt was still profoundly lonely. His only companion was Guen, and the magic that brought her to this world also sent the cat away all too often.\nNot long thereafter, he discovered a city of svirfneblin, gnomes that live in the Underdark. This was what he had been seeking: a civilization that valued the same concepts of honor, loyalty, and goodness that he did. Careful not to reveal himself to the gnomes right away, Drizzt stealthily made his way into, around, and then back out of the city he learned was called Blingdenstone.\nLater, convinced that this was the life he was destined to have, Drizzt reentered the city -- only to be taken prisoner by the wary gnomes. Fortunately, he came into contact with a deep gnome he had met once before. Before Drizzt fled from drow society, he had been assigned to go on a patrol. This patrol encountered a group of deep gnomes and killed them all -- except for one warrior named Belwar Dissengulp. Drizzt, hoping to save at least one life from being massacred, pleaded with the other elves to spare this one’s life -- arguing that it would be better to allow him to return to his people and tell of drow ferocity than just leave another corpse. Drizzt’s brother Dinin did agree to let the gnome live, but chopped off both of Belwar’s hands first.\nWhen Drizzt again met Belwar, the gnome had two great metal hammers attached to his wrists in place of his hands. Belwar, remembering that Drizzt had saved his life, convinced the other gnomes to give him a chance. Drizzt proved himself soon thereafter when he, Belwar, and a pech named Clacker who had been polymorphed into a hook horror by a mad wizard worked together to defeat the wizard and the mind flayers that were in the area. During this time Drizzt also found himself facing his deceased father in combat. Zaknafen had been brought back as one of the undead by an unholy drow ritua. But, knowing that the creature was not truly his father, Drizzt spared no effort in destroying it.\nFeeling he needed to put yet more distance between himself and his drow past, Drizzt fled to the surfilce world, where he witnessed a sunrise for the first time in his life.\nHe eventually met the blind ranger Montolio \"Mooshie\" DeBrouchee, who taught Drizzt the ways of the surface world and the concepts of being a ranger, and introduced him to the existence of the goddess Mielikki, the Lady of the Forest. With Mooshie’s help, Drizzt began his career as a ranger, defeated a large band of orcs, and vanquished a pair of barghests.\nAfter Mooshie passed away, Drizzt again took to wandering, this time on the surfac world. After a time he came to Icewind Dale and the region known as Ten Towns. Under the terms of a deal he made with Cassius, the region’s leader, Drizzt took up residence in the area in exchange for his regular patrolling of the region to watch out for incursions of barbarians. \nBefore long, Drizzt met the dwarf who was to become one of his dearest friends: Bruenor Battlehammer, who busy battling a remorhaz at the time. By the time Drizzt arrived to help, the beast was dead. Drizzt also came to know the dwarf’s adopted human daughter Catti-brie and the halfling Regis.\nWhen Bruenor spared the life of one of the barbarians who later attacked Ten Towns, Drizzt became acquainted with Wulfgar. Over time, the young man matured, due in no little measure to Drizzt’s training him to use his brain as well as his brawn in battle. \nThis training was put to good use when a power-mad mage attacked Ten Towns with a horde of humanoids. The townsfolk, barbarians, and heroes defeated the humanoids, and Drizzt overcame the tanar’ri Errtu.\nDrizzt and the other members of the band later accompanied Bruenor on his quest to retake his ancestral homeland, Mirthal Hall. It was here that Drizzt met for the first time the man who would become his nemesis. The human assassin Artemis Entreri was originally after Regis the halfling, but found his mirror image, and his real foe, in Drizzt. After a battle with Drizzt that proved inconclusive, Artemis kidnapped Regis, and the heroes followed him all the way to the distant southern city of Calimport to rescue their friend. Drizzt and Artemis met once more, but again there was no clear winner.\nAfter releasing Regis, the heroes returned north and did reconquer Mithral Hall. All seemed peaceful for a time, but then drow spies found a way into Mirthral Hall from below, and Artemis returned, magically disguised as Regis.\nDrizzt eventually found where Artemis was holding the real Regis, and the ranger and the assassin again did battle. They were both attacked by drow before any conclusion could be reached, however. They fought again later, and Artemis fell over a cliff. Wulfgar met his end at this time when, caught in the grasp of a handmaiden of Lolth, he used his magical hammer to collapse the ceiling onto them both.\nDrizzt soon decided that he had to return to Menzoberranzan to put an end to the drow meddling in his life, and Catti-brie followed him. The pair eventually discovered that Artemis was still alive and working for the drow -- though he suspected he was being used and would be killed as soon as he had done what the drow wanted of him. When the time came to flee back to the surface, the three of them worked together to defeat the drow. Artemis and Drizzt seemed to have come to an accord and parted without further violence.\nThe same could not be said for Drizzt's other enemies. The drow, the fiend Errtu, and others all conspired in an attempt to bring down Drizzt and Mithral Hall. An army of drow and humanoid slaves invaded, and it took the combined forces of the dwarves, the deep gnomes, and the humans to defeat them.\nDeciding again it was time to move on, Drizzt and his dear friend Catti-brie rode away from Mithral Hall. At present that is where Drizzt's tale ends -- but what is yet to be told is likely to be as thrilling as what has come before. \nSources: Homeland, Exile, Sojourn, The Crystal Shard, Streams of Silver, The Halfling’s Gem, The Legacy, Starless Night, Siege of Darkness, Passage to Dawn, The Silent Blade, Spine of the World, Servant of the Shard (October 2000)\nGuenhwyvar: Medium magical beast; HD 6d8+18; hp 45; Init +7 (Improved Initiative); Spd 30'; AC 16; Atk +11/+11/+6 melee (1d4 [x2] claws, 1d12 bite, 2d4 [x2] rake if both claws hit); SA spring; SD scent; AL N; SV Fort +8, Ref +8, Will +3; Str 22, Dex 16, Con 16, Int 9, Wis 12, Cha 10.\nSkills and Feats: Hide +8, Listen +6, Move Silently +10, Spot +8, Improved Initiative\nSpecial Attacks: Spring: If Guenhwyvar leaps on a foe during the first round of combat, she can make an all-out attack even if she has taken a move action, she can also make a grapple attack as a free action.\nSpecial Defenses: Scent: Guenhwyvar can detect other creatures within 30' by scent and gains +8 to tracking rolls.\nDrizzt’s closest companion is the animal that emerges from his figurine of wondrous power, the onyx panther called Guenhwyvar. The panther can be summoned forth from the figurine up to three times per week, for a total of 24 hours altogether during that time. If she is slain while activated, she reverts to the figurine form, and can be called forth again later.\nWhile Guen cannot speak, it is clear the panther dearly loves her master and his comrades. On occasions too many to number, Guen’s fighting prowess and sharp claws have been the difference between victory and defeat for Drizzt.\n* The official version of this character in future printed products may vary from what is presented here.\nI’d like to thank Wizards of the Coast for putting out such a great game, R.A.

The princess \nArgenta ruled over this peaceful land and the people were secure and happy.  Then one day a warrior \nriding a red dragon appeared in the skies over the princess’ castle and almost overnight the tiny kingdom \nfell into ruin.  Now only ruins and rumors remain, and what legends there are tell of a fabulous ruby still \nburied somewhere within the Palace of the Silver Princess. \n \nThis module is for use with the D&D® 3rd Edition rules and is specially designed for beginning players and \nDMs. Contained within are maps of the palace and its dungeons, background information, and rumors \nand legends as well as many new monsters. \n \n© 1981, TSR Hobbies, Inc., All Rights Reserved. \nDistributed to the book trade in the United States by Random House, Inc. and in Canada by Random \n\nHouse of Canada, Ltd. \nDistributed to the toy and hobby trade by regional distributors. \nDUNGEONS & DRAGONS and D&D are registered trademarks of TSR Hobbies, Inc. \nTSR Hobbies, Inc. \nPOB 756 \nLake Geneva, WI 53147 \n9044 \nPRINTED IN U.S.A. \nISBN 0–935696–31–8 \n \nProduct Number: 9044 \nYear Published:  1981 \n \nConverted from Basic Dungeons and Dragons to 3rd Edition D&D by Erica Balsley \n(CountryGrrlHere@aol.com) \n3rd Edition conversion edited by Scott Greene (keeper@rpgplanet.com) \nLast Updated: 08/01/01 \n \nSummary of Conversion:  This is a conversion of the original version of this module, as presented on \nthe Wizards of the Coast website.  Just as a special note to DMs: WARNING!  This module is what we \nexperienced gamers call a Monty Haul!  There is a LOT of treasure here, but not a lot of monsters or traps \nguarding it.  You may want to consider taking out a lot of the loot to keep your player characters from \nbecoming fabulously wealthy, or add a lot more monsters.  I didn’t change any of the treasure values \nwhen I did this conversion, except for the value of the ice harp (now harp of charming) in room EL 24 (its \nvalue came out much higher using the magic item creation rules than the value it was given originally). \n \nGENERAL CONVERSION NOTES \n1. A few minor grammatical and spelling errors were corrected in the text. \n2. All traps have been converted based on or modified from the Sample Mechanical Traps list on page \n\n115 of the DMG. \n3. All treasure and trap descriptions have been moved from the general text describing the room and \n\ngiven their own paragraph to make them easier for the DM to discern. \n4. All unfinished rooms and descriptions from the original module have been left unfinished as the \n\nauthor originally intended.  The DM can fill these in by using the Dungeon Encounter Tables in the \nDMG (pages 118–126 of the DMG). \n\n5. Any references to the Basic D&D rulebooks have been changed to refer to the proper 3rd Edition Core \nRulebook. \n\n6. General conversions from Basic D&D to 3rd Edition are underlined. \n7. I added blank description blocks for rooms EL 37 and EL 38, which seem to have been left out of the \n\noriginal text. \n\n\n\n8. I converted the pre–generated characters in the back of the module by giving them maximum hit \npoints for their class, and re–calculating their hit points and AC using 3e rules.  I also gave the \ndemihumans classes based on the abilities and weapons they were given.  I didn’t choose skills or \nfeats for these pre–gens, leaving that up to any player that might want to select one to run. \n\n9. References to magic and magic items have been altered from bold to italic to reflect the new format \nused in 3rd Edition. \n\n10.  The rules for lifting the portcullises have been replaced by Strength DCs.  I converted these by \ndividing the number of Strength points required to lift the portcullis in the original module by 5, and \nadding that to 15. \n\n11.  The section on drowning (page 7 of the original module) was removed in its entirety since new rules \ncover drowning. \n\n \nSPECIFIC CONVERSIONS \n1. The tinker and his daughter now have stats. The tinker is a 5th-level Expert, and his daughter is a 1st-\n\nlevel Expert. The class skills for the tinker (and the key ability for each skill) are: Appraise (Int), Bluff \n(Cha), Craft (any three) (Int), Handle Animal (Cha), Innuendo (Wis), Knowledge (local lore and \nrumors) (Int), Profession (tinker) (Int), Spot (Wis), and Sense Motive (Wis).  They are otherwise \nidentical to the Commoner class. \n\n2. On the rumor list, the rumor about how the Palace came to be in its dilapidated state has no \nindication as to whether or not it is true or false.  I made it false. \n\n3. I made a few changes to the random encounter charts.  I changed the acolytes to adepts, the \nbarbarians to barbarians, and the cave bear to a dire badger (at 6 HD, even a regular brown bear is a \nbit much for low–level characters!). \n\n4. I changed the cave bear cub in room EL 8 to a regular bear cub (I used the brown bear stats, and \ndropped the size to Small and the HD to 2). \n\n5. The illusion of the warrior in room EL 12 has been given the stats and abilities of a 1st level warrior \nNPC class, and is assumed to be a figment from a shadow conjuring spell. \n\n6. I changed the name of the ice harp in room EL 24 to a harp of charming, keeping in line with the 3e \nformat of giving magic items names that better describe their abilities. \n\n7. Since stone golems are a little too tough for a 1st–3rd level module, I converted the crystal warrior in \nroom UL 2 as just a Medium–size animated object. Think of it as a bargain basement stone golem \nthat the palace wizard whipped up with an animate object and permanence spell. Stone Golem Lite! \n\n8. The ghosts of Princess Argenta and the Silver Warrior have been converted as the ghosts of a 5th-\nlevel aristocrat (Argenta) and a 5th-level fighter (Silver Warrior). In the description of this encounter, I \nalso made a clarification about the legends behind the Palace of the Silver Princess, and made a few \nalterations to the nature of the encounter with these two restless spirits. Now, instead of just an \nencounter with two ghosts, it’s an encounter with a good and an evil ghost at odds with each other.  I \nalso added a few unpleasant political consequences for the characters gaining such a valuable \ngemstone as “My Lady’s Heart.” \n\n9. I converted Cathrandamus as a chaotic evil cleric of Nerull. The two dwarves, Xyzom and Boron, are \nchaotic evil rogue dwarves (rogue in the true sense, that is, not the rogue character class).  Aleigha \nthe werebear is but a naïve innocent who has been misled by Cathrandamus’ charisma and power. \n\n10.  I rearranged the description of the Sword of Spartrusia to allow player–character bards to make \nBardic Knowledge checks to learn about the legends behind the sword. \n\n11.  There were “wolf soldiers” on the encounter chart at the end of the module, but no mention of who \nthey are or what they are doing in the Palace.  I wrote a short description of them and gave them a \nreason to be in the ruins. \n\n12.  I made a few changes to the nature of some of the original monsters, to affect a better conversion to \n3rd Edition.  I’ve tinkered a little with their descriptions and abilities, but they are mostly as they were \noriginally written. \na. Archer Bushes: These plants can’t move and don’t really attack on their own except as a reflex \n\nreaction, so I converted them as a wilderness hazard rather than an actual monster. \nb. Barics.   Barics, in D&D 3rd Edition, are Small beasts. I dropped their base hit dice down to 2, \n\nsince Small monsters rarely have 5 HD as the barics were originally written. Even at 2 HD, the 5 \nHD of the original barics is still well within the advancement range if the DM wants to beef them \nback up. There is only one half–dead baric in this adventure, and it is severely weakened from \n\n\n\nstarvaion, so reducing the barics to 2 HD wont affect “continuity” or the flow of the adventure at \nall. \n\nc. Bubbles.   I altered the description of the bubbles somewhat, and expanded their capabilities.  \nThey are still weird, though. \n\nd. Decapus.   I increased the base HD of the decapus from 3 HD to 5 HD, bringing it more in line \nwith its size (assumed from the cover art), and the number and type of special abilities it has.  \nThis is now probably the most dangerous monster in the module, and will pose quite a challenge \nto most low–level parties! \n\ne. Giant Marmosets:  There seemed to be a discrepancy in the size of this animal. In the text \ndescribing them in the dungeon they are 8 feet tall, but in the text describing the monster itself it \nsays that “Some monkeys grow large enough for a halfling to comfortably ride . . .” Well, at 8 feet \ntall, a human could practically ride one!  I dropped their size to 5 feet tall, with a 7-foot long tail.  \nOtherwise, I converted them as written. \n\nf. Jupiter Bloodsuckers: I expanded the description of the Jupiter bloodsucker, and detailed its \nabilities a little more. \n\ng. Protectors.   I gave the protectors the ability to case divine spells, since they had no powers at all \nin the original version other than to float around and be lawful. Giving these creatures divine spell \nability wont affect the flow of the module at all. As a matter of fact, the things are barely even \nused in the adventure, except in the capacity of “innkeepers” in the tower level. Giving them these \npowers wont really change all that much, and will make a powerless creature a little more useful \nin other adventures, should a DM want to use them.  They are now effective lawful neutral \noutsiders who can use divine magic to further the goals of law. \n\nh. Purple Moss.   I converted this as a dungeon hazard, rather than an actual monster. I also \nexpanded its abilities and how fire affects it. \n\ni. Ubues.   These odd beings only live in the Misty Swamp and its environs. Taking a cue from the \ntext, one could assume that they are the result of a polymorph spell that went awry in the wild–\nmagic swamp. I also converted them as Large humanoids since they didn’t seem strong enough \nto be giants, and I couldn’t tell from the picture how big they were. \n\n \nDungeons & Dragons® 3rd Edition \n\nDungeon Module #B3 \nPalace of the Silver Princess \n\nPART 1: INTRODUCTION \nA great many of the things found in the Palace of the Silver Princess are there to add color and to give \nthe DM ideas upon which to expand. This module has been specially designed to give the beginning DM, \nas well as the more experienced DM, a framework on which to build a whole dungeon complex.  This \nmodule can also be used as the basis for an ongoing campaign, as it provides rumors, legends and other \ninformation that give a campaign foundation and background.  To expand the dungeon, the DM need but \nopen up the blocked passageways and add new and challenging dungeon levels.  This should be done \nonly after most of the encounter areas have been explored. \n\nMany of the rooms have spaces for monsters, treasure, and/or traps.  Some examples have been \ngiven of how to stock these rooms in other areas of this module.  By leaving some areas blank, the DM \ncan use creativity to add challenge to the module and make it fit into his or her world and campaign.  It \nalso insures that even if some players read the module before playing in it, they will not know exactly \nwhat is going to happen in every room.  Do not fill all of the rooms at once. Leave some empty to be filled \nat a later time. This will help add color and suspense to the adventure; a room visited earlier which proved \nto be empty and a possible resting place might be occupied now by a monster that doesn’t wish to share \nits room with adventurers. Many monsters and treasures can be found in the DUNGEONS & \nDRAGONS® 3e Core Rules. These are the ones that should be used until the players have advanced \npast third level. \n\nThe new monsters and treasures found in this module should not be used until the entire module has \nbeen explored, and the DM has drawn new maps to expand the palace. These new monsters and \ntreasures have been placed in certain areas and play balance has been carefully considered in placing \nthem. If these monsters and/or treasures are moved elsewhere in the module before the players discover \nthem where they have originally been placed, the module will become unbalanced and perhaps too \n\n\n\ndifficult, especially for first level adventurers. Once all the monsters and treasures have been discovered, \nthe DM may wish to place new monsters and treasures elsewhere. \n\nThis module, like all DUNGEONS & DRAGONS products, is a guideline to use as a creative basis for \nyour own campaign.  It is designed to teach a new DM how to design and run a D&D adventure, while not \nbeing too difficult for low level adventurers and new players. Good luck and enjoy. \n \n\nPART 2: \nDUNGEON MASTER’S INFORMATION \n\nThe information given below should be read carefully.  Part of it can be given to players.  It will be up to \nthe DM to decide exactly what the players should know about the palace.  This information can be altered \nif desired.  The DM is encouraged to add whatever he or she wants to this information to give more color \nto the palace. \n\nThe dead soldiers found on the entrance level are from an unnamed army.  It will be up to the DM to \ndecide where they came from, why they are in the palace and any other information concerning the dead \nsoldiers.  They could be from a lost city; from a hidden fortress of highly skilled thieves and fighters; or \nfrom a forgotten race or tribe of people.  The DM could even have these soldiers be a scouting party for a \nlarger brigade who plan on taking the ruined palace and making it a fort or base station from which to \nwork.  The possibilities are as endless as the imagination of the DM. \n\nThe dungeon is constructed of marble.  The doors are of iron–reinforced oak (2” thick, hardness 5, 20 \nhp, Break DC stuck 23, locked 25).  The passageways are fairly clean due to the gelatinous cube that \nroams the hallways.  All passageways are 10’×10’. \n\nTorch sconces are mounted every ten feet along all the passageways on alternating sides.  None \nhave torches.  Arrases will frequently be seen throughout the palace as well as pots of dead plant life. \n \n\nLegend \nAncient legends of the land speak of a beautiful young princess called Argenta who lived in a wonderful \nenchanted palace made of every type of marble known.  Her palace was in the heart of a rich, fertile \nvalley filled with gentle creatures that could do no harm.  Exotic flowers and plant life grew everywhere, \nwater ran sweet, and clear and the skies were always clear and warm. \n\nMica flickered in all the rocks and was often found in the streams making them glisten like diamonds \nin the bright sunlight.  Early morning dewdrops clung gently to leaves of small trees and grass, appearing \nlike fairy jewels scattered from wild dance the night before.  Wild birds with long, colorful tails and bright \nfaces filled the air with the sweet sounds of their love songs.  Tiny animals freely darted in and out of the \nunderbrush, fearing nothing, as there were no enemies anywhere to be found.  The dwarves that lived in \nthe valley loved Princess Argenta very much.  They worked her silver and ruby mines so that the elves \nthat shared the valley with them could make beautiful jewelry and weapons.  Everything in the valley was \npeaceful. \n\nOne day, according to legend, a ruby the size of an apple was found.  A perfect ruby.  The dwarves \ncut the ruby carefully so that its size would not be diminished.  The elves polished the ruby until it shone \nso that it was almost impossible to gaze upon.  They presented it to the princess and told her that it was \nas lovely as she, and they called it “My Lady’s Heart.”  So pleased was the princess that she decided to \nhonor her friends, the elves and dwarves, with a grand party; a masquerade ball.  Everyone was invited to \ncome. \n\nOne the eve of the grand ball, people poured into the valley from everywhere.  How so many people \nhad heard about the party no one knew, but the princess did not mind.  She was proud of the ruby and \nwanted everyone to see “My Lady’s Heart.”  She should not have been so eager to show the ruby, as one \nguest was interested in more than its beauty alone.  He had come to steal it.  His eyes also roamed freely \nto the princess, and he gazed upon her as much as he gazed upon the brilliant gem.  Princess Argenta \nsaw this, and in her innocence smiled backed at him.  Two dwarves and an elf saw this, and when they \nchallenged him after the party, they were never seen or heard from again. \n\nMany weeks after the party a red dragon was seen in the skies of the valley.  The dragon burned the \nrich land with its breath and terrorized the gentle people of the valley.  The land was left scorched and \nbarren.  Those valley people unfortunate to get close enough to the dragon (but fortunate enough to live) \nswore that they saw a man in silver and blue armor riding on its back. \n\nSome folks still say that they see a red dragon in the skies over the valley.  Many say that they see a \nsaddle on the dragon’s back and loose reins near its head. \n\n\n\nThe valley is now dead, the palace is in ruins.  No one knows exactly what happened to the princess.  \nSome believe that the man on the dragon carried her away.  Others think that he killed her and stole what \ntreasure he could find.  But all stories say that the ruby, “My Lady’s Heart,” is still hidden in the palace. \n \n\nLands, Cities, and Villages \nThe information given below describes the surrounding lands near the Palace of the Silver Princess in the \nland of the Princes of Glantri. \n\nA brief outline of each village is given, including its size and what the life is like there.  There is one \nBarony, and this seat of rulership controls most of the area.  Further information about the surrounding \nland may be added by the DM where and when desired. \n\nAs play continues and the characters advance beyond 3rd level, the DM may plan adventures into the \nneighboring wilderness, as a break from dungeon adventures or as part of a dungeon adventure.  \nRemember, characters must travel through the mountains and wilderness before actually reaching the \npalace ruins.  However, DMs are urged not to attempt wilderness adventures until players have reached \nexpert level and are now using the D&D® Expert game rules. \n\nGulluvia: This is a ruthless place filled with terror.  The ruler of this chaotic nightmare is Lady D’hmis.  \nShe rules this barony with a firm and unforgiving hand.  To gain supreme rulership of the tiny barony, she \nkilled her husband. A prime example of the type of laws her ladyship favors is one forbidding males, \nexcept those in her service, from being on the streets after the sunset unless accompanied by a female \nwho is age 15 or older.  This law meets little resistance, as everyone fears her baronial guards.  Though \nD’hmis’ warriors are primarily male, her commanders are all females; tough, chaotic women who instill \nfear by a mere gaze and who fear little save D’hmis and the elite male fighters who serve as her personal \nbodyguards and paramours. \n\nDead Mule: This little shire was once a peaceful place, named by the group of miners who settled \nhere after their pack mule died.  The shire is now occupied by Gulluvian soldiers, and no one in the shire \nseems to know why. All they know is that soldiers camp outside the shire, and occasionally terrorize the \nsurrounding countryside.  If the mayor knows why the soldiers are here, he isn’t saying. \n\nN’Sau: This small farming village is still untouched by the cruel hand of D’hmis.  The village is so \nsmall that there is no tavern or inn here.  A small general store doubles as a tavern or meeting hall when \nneeded.  The main crop grown here is wheat. \n\nThorold: This lovely little village prides itself on the fact that it raises the best thoroughbred horses in \nall of Glantri for the Barony of Gulluvia.  Thorold, though it appears peaceful and perhaps even lawful, is \njust as chaotic as Gulluvia.  The mayor of Thorold is a distant cousin of D’hmis, and follows her laws and \norders to the letter.  The village is rather large and has three taverns, a general store, and two smithies. \n\nMere: This tiny village is primarily inhabited by halflings, though human folk, elves and dwarves live \nhere too.  This village is also under the protection of Gulluvia, but because it is located so near the Misty \nSwamp, D’hmis has little to do with it except at tax time, which is every three months.  Escaped slaves \nand prisoners come here to equip themselves before journeying north through the swamp.  Mereians say \nnothing about the slaves or prisoners, fearing that D’hmis would send guards to their village to catch them \n(and they want as little to do with Gulluvia as possible).  This village has two taverns, one general store, \nand an inn. \n\nVelders: This canton is under the protection of Gulluvia, though this does Velders little good.  The \nGulluvian guards fear the Abaddon Woods and do not like to travel through it to reach Velders except in \nlarge groups.  Orcs, kobolds and other vile creatures make periodic raids on the small farms on the \noutskirts of the canton.  There is only a trading post in the center of town. \n\nMisty Swamp: No one knows exactly what lies behind the veil of ever–present mist that hovers over \nthe swamp.  Some old timers say that the dwarves who make Anterian Brandy live in the swamp near \ntheir secret ingredient, the swamp water.  This is speculation, as no one really knows what the secret \ningredient of Anterian Brandy is.  Others whisper tales of an evil wizard living there in a massive tower of \nshiny black stone.  Sometimes, in the dead of winter, fierce thunderstorms can be heard near the swamp, \nbut no one ever sees any lightning.  The only thing people who live near the swamp will agree on is that \nmost wizards and elves had best stay clear of it or they will find that their spells will not function properly.  \nOne young wizard tried to catch a rabbit with a web spell near the swamp one day and ended up with \ndozens of rabbits, all neatly webbed, scattered about her feet.  She didn’t really mind having the extra \nrabbits, but the fact that she couldn’t control her magic scared her (as it does many other spell casters).  \nShe was one of the fortunate ones; others have not been so lucky.  Once a band of daring adventurers \n\n\n\nignored warnings not to venture into the swamp.  Months later only the cleric returned.  He told tales of \ntheir battle against creatures made of colored mist, and others that had no visible form at all.  He said \nthey constantly fought strange looking creatures with three heads, three arms, and three legs.  He told of \nhow their brave elf attempted to cast a magic missile at a beast who was attacking one of the fighters.  \nSuddenly, however, the elf changed into a rhinoceros and wandered away into the swamp.  Before any \nmore information could be obtained from the cleric he died.  No wounds could be found, and the folks \nwho found him swear he must have been scared to death.  The DM can choose how any given spell cast \nin the swamp will be changed.  The effects should be unexpected by the players, but instant death results \nshould not be used.  Suggested effects are: \n \n1. Spell backfires on the caster of the party \n2. Spell fails: nothing happens \n3. Caster throws a different spell of the same level \n4. Spell effect is tripled \n5. Caster or a member of the party glows for 24 hours \n6. Caster or a party member changed into a creature with hit dice equal to the character’s level: lasts 24 \n\nhours \n \nEffects like 5 and 6 can be removed (once the party has left the swamp) by using a dispel magic spell. \n\nAbaddon Woods: This is a desolate place inhibited by evil beings, but was once believed to be filled \nwith unicorns, elves, faeries and other fair creatures.  Many expeditions attempting to destroy the evil \nlurking here have ventured into the woods, but have never returned. \n\nMoorfowl Mountains: This ugly, dead, tall range forms a protective shield that keeps the mist from \nMisty Swamp from spreading into the neighboring farmlands.  Most folks don’t venture into the mountains \nmuch any more except to hunt for certain types of moss used by local healers.  Evil creatures now roam \nthe mountains freely and inhabit the mines once worked by the dwarves who served the Silver Princess.  \nThese mines now are barren and not worth working. \n\nThunder Mountains: These low pine–covered mountains see the sunlight infrequently.  Most of the \ntime thick storm clouds linger on the mountaintops — clouds that often erupt into violent thunderstorms.  \nAn evil wizardess is rumored to live in the mountains in a giant hollow oak she uses as a lab.  It is \nbelieved that it is she who keeps the thunderstorms alive, partly because she fears the light and partly \nbecause it keeps away the curious.  Local people don’t recall anyone ever going into the mountains, and \nif anyone ever did, they never returned to tell about it. \n \n\nThe Tinker and His Daughter \nA small tinker’s shop located in Gulluvia is run by an old man and his daughter.  The tinker is a jovial \nfellow called Lamdomon, who, though aged, still retains his youthful thick white hair and clear steel blue \neyes.  His daughter, a shy girl, rather plain, but not unattractive, keeps house and runs most of his \nerrands.  She is called Zappora.  Her fiery red hair falls just to her waist and her green eyes, says \nLamdomon, shame even the brightest forest.  Zappora is very superstitious and will never do anything \nthat might bring bad luck or invite evil spirits.  She always carries a pair of dice, a package of salt, a bud \nof garlic, and a small fire agate (a stone found in Moorfowl Mountains that is supposed to ward off evil \nspirits).  Both travel to the villages around Gulluvia (except for Velders) once amonth to pick up pots and \npans to repair and to exchange gossip with the housewives. \n\nWhen Lamdomon and Zappora travel, they do so in a wagon designed and built by him.  This wagon \nhas a 15’ square base supported by 4 sturdy spoked wheels.  The front wheels are much smaller than the \nrear ones to provide easier turning ability.  The top of the wagon is dome shaped, and covered in thick \nhides.  A small opening in the top allows the smoke from the fire bowl to escape.  In the rain, cold weather \nor when moving, this opening is usually closed.  Entrance into the wagon is from the rear by way of a set \nof folding steps.  These steps can be folded and tucked away under the wagon in order to save space \nand not hinder the movement of the wagon when not in use.  The dome shape of the wagon allows \ncomplete freedom of movement without having to stoop except near the very edge of the wagon where \nthe top connects with the wagon base.  The entire structure is about three feet off the ground, is pulled by \na team of oxen, and is capable of floating across rivers and lakes.  Just before entering a village, bells are \nhung on the oxen and the wheels of the wagon to signal the arrival of the tinker. \n\n\n\nThe tinker and his daughter not only supply the villagers with needed repairs, but also are a source of \nnews from other villages.  The DM may change any of the information given about the tinker.  Only the \nmost interesting facts about the tinker are given, as well as some hints as to whom or what the tinker may \nactually be.  Lamdomon, because he travels to all the villages near Gulluvia, and is not considered a \nthreat to the villagers, knows some information that not everyone in a local bar or tavern may have.  \nBuilding onto what is already given will provide the DM with a special NPC (non–player character) who is \nnot actually one of the normal D&D classes, but can be used as an important information gatherer who \nmay freely chat with the player characters (provided that they happen to meet him). \n\nNPCs are characters that the DM may play in the campaign.  Generally, NPCs are used only when \nthe party is not large enough to venture into a dungeon, or wilderness.  However, they can be used as a \nmethod of helping players solve problems and provide information (though their information can and \nshould from time to time be wrong or useless).  The DM will have to monitor the input of the NPC carefully \nso that the fun and mystery, as well as challenge, is not spoiled for players.  If done properly and used \nwith care, NPCs can add an extra dimension to an ongoing campaign and provide fun for the DM.  Not all \nDMs opt to use NPCs, so it will be up to the DM to decide if the NPCs found in this module are to have \ncomplete personalities.  The personality and history need not be thought out all at once.  It can be \nrevealed slowly as the campaign continues, as facts about the NPC are discovered by the characters. \nLamdomon’s home is his shop and work area.  The front room is filled with all sorts of curiosities: old \nclocks, broken vases, several old sword blades with strange runes carved into them, a blue orb, a couple \nof red dragon teeth, many brooches and rings, worn kettles and pots, and a couple of old benches that \nseem likely to fall apart if sat on.  When asked why he keeps these items, he replies, “Once they were \nimportant to many people, now they are only important to me.”  The other room on this floor is the small \nkitchen where Zappora makes herbal medicines to sell to village housewives. \n\nThis room is neat and orderly.  Two bedrooms are located upstairs.Lamdomon’s room is filled with \nnormal bedroom furnishings, as well as a suit of silver armor covered by a blanket, and a strange set of \nriding equipment that appears too large for a horse.  Zappora’s room is also filled with normal bedroom \nfurnishings, and a few herbs hang from the ceiling drying.  Under her pillow she keeps a dagger.  The \ndagger is supposed to keep away evil spirits that cause nightmares. \n \n\nLamdomon the Tinker, male Human Exp5: CR 3; Medium–size humanoid (Human); HD 5d6+5; hp \n21; Init –1; Spd 30 ft.; AC 12 (–1 Dex, +3 leather armor); Atk +2 melee (1d4–1, dagger); AL NG; SV Fort \n+2, Ref +0, Will +6; Str 8, Dex 9, Con 12, Int 12, Wis 15, Cha 12. \n\nSkills Appraise +9, Bluff +8, Handle Animal +7, Innuendo +10, Knowledge (local lore and rumors) +9, \nProfession (tinker) +9, Spot +10, Sense Motive +10. \n \n\nZappora, female Human Exp1: CR ½; Medium–size humanoid (Human); HD 1d6+1; hp 7; Init +1; \nSpd 30 ft.; AC 11 (+1 Dex); Atk –1 melee (1d4–1, dagger); AL NG; SV Fort +1, Ref +1, Will +2; Str 8, Dex \n13, Con 12, Int 10, Wis 11, Cha 15. \n\nSkills Appraise +4, Bluff +5, Craft (cook) +4, Handle Animal +6, Knowledge (local lore and rumors) \n+3, Profession (tinker) +3, Spot +3, Sense Motive +4. \n \n\nRumors \nIn the beginning of this module a legend and several stories are given about the palace and the princess.  \nThese stories and the legend may be modified by the DM if desired and given to the characters in the \nform of rumors.  If rumors are given out, the DM should read the legend and the stories several times, \nnoting what the characters should know. \n\nOther rumors may be circulated.  These can be false or true, and it will be up to the DM to decide \nwhat, how, and when these rumors are told.  In the section before this, a short description of a tinker and \nhis daughter is given.  This tinker may be used by the DM to spread rumors to the characters. \n\nRumors add color, clues, and give the players a base to work from.  If this module is going to be used \nas a basis for a D&D campaign, the DM may want to add more rumors to the campaign as the knowledge \nof the game increases.  One way to help spread rumors is a rumor sheet or monthly campaign newsletter.  \nThis type of extra feature adds to the characters’ knowledge of the game and lets the DM spread tales of \nthe city, world or campaign easily.  It also helps stir interest in the campaign for players who cannot make \nevery game session. \n\n\n\nBelow are a few rumors that the DM may wish to let players know.  Some are false, as denoted by \nthe F after the sentence, but can be made true if the DM wishes to incorporate them into the module.  \nOthers are both true and false in part and an explanation will appear after the rumor. \n \n1. A fierce young female fighter called Aliegha has been seen in a few of the neighboring villages.  Many \n\nfolks say that she carries a sword of ruby and is accompanied by two dwarves and a cleric.  Some \nbelieve that she might be a descendant of the Silver Princess. \n\n2. The evil of Baroness of Gulluvia, Lady D’hmis, has offered a reward to anyone who can bring to her \nthe ruby known as “My Lady’s Heart.”  Lady D’hmis claims to be the heir to the treasure as she is the \nonly living descendant of the Silver Princess.  F & T (False about the reward.  True about her claim.) \n\n3. Many strange beings have been seen near the northern woods.  These creatures, say survivors, have \nthree heads, three arms, and three legs.  So far five people have been killed by the horrible beasts.  \nFarmers complain that their cattle, chickens and other farm animals keep disappearing, and they are \nblaming the disappearances on these creatures. \n\n4. The Misty Swamp changes arcane spells in strange and unpredictable ways. \n5. A rich treasure is hidden in the Palace of the Silver Princess.  This treasure is said to be even more \n\nvaluable than “My Lady’s Heart.”  F \n6. Lady Argenta is still alive and living with a band of elves that rescued her from the warrior in silver \n\nand blue armor.  It is said that she is still as fair as she was nearly 500 years ago.  F \n7. A great cleric called Cathrandamus is roaming the country aiding the sick and defending the just.  It is \n\nsaid that he cares not for riches, but only for spiritual gain.  T & F (True as there is such a cleric by \nthat name.  False as he does care for wealth and is most certainly not a good person.) \n\n8. Half of the palace was destroyed by one of Argenta’s wizards when he accidentally mixed the wrong \nmagical components together.  F \n\n \nPortcullises, Double Portcullises and Doors \n\nPortcullises and double portcullises are not like doors.  These are gates made of crossed iron bars \nspaced 3” apart, blocking passageways.  They must be lifted by the players and this can be done by \neither physical strength using Strength checks or by a knock  spell.  At most encounter areas blocked by a \nportcullis, a Strength check DC will be given. \n\nIn determining how long a portcullis will stay up, roll a die, either 1d4 or 1d6 (which die to use will be \ngiven in the description of the portcullis).  If a 1 is rolled, the gate will come crashing down after it is \nreleased producing a very loud noise that might possibly attract a wandering monster.  If any other \nnumber is rolled, the portcullis will remain up for as many rounds as indicated on the die.  When a knock  \nspell is used, the portcullis will remain up for the maximum number of rounds before slipping back down. \n \n\nHow to Use the Wandering Monster Table \nEvery other turn, the DM should make a check for a wandering monster.  A roll of 1 on d6 indicates an \nencounter.  The monster will be 20–120 feet away when encountered.  Use the special tables given here \nto determine the type of monster encountered.  Stats for these monsters can be found at the end of this \nmodule. \n \n\nWandering Monster Table \nEntrance Level \n\nDie Roll Monster No. Appearing \n1 Adept 1–8 \n2 Bandit 1–8 \n3 Kobold 4–16 \n4 Orc 2–8 \n5 Skeleton 3–12 \n6 Dire Badger 1 \n\n \nUpper Level \n\nDie Roll Monster No. Appearing \n1 Goblin 2–8 \n2 Ubue 2–5 \n\n\n\n3 Bandit 1–8 \n4 Barbarians 1–6 \n5 Hobgoblin 1–6 \n6 Gelatinous Cube 1 \n\n \nThe 1st–3rd Level Dungeon Encounter Tables given on page 122 in the DMG may also be used after most \nof the palace has been explored by the players. \n \n\nHow to Use the Area Descriptions \nThe information given for each numbered area is divided into two parts.  The boxed information should be \nread to the players by the DM. This information represents what the characters see or what happens as \nsoon as they enter the area.  The unboxed information is for the DM.  Some of it tells the DM how to run \nthe encounter, but some of it, like the information about treasure, will be given to the players as their \ncharacters search the area. \n\nSome area descriptions will have blank spaces for descriptions, treasures, monsters, or traps.  These \nareas can be used as empty rooms, or can be stocked with whatever the DM wants.  There will be \nexamples given at the end of the module, but it’s more fun for the DM to make up his or her own. \n\nFor example, in room 1F (Entrance Level), a DM might decide to place the following: \nDescription: The room is empty.  However, there is a 5’ wide section of the east wall that has been \n\nbricked up with slightly discolored stone blocks.  There is an iron ring 5’ off the floor in the center of this \nsection. \n\nMonster: In the secret niche behind the trapped wall section are three skeletons. \nSkeletons (3): hp 3, 3, 2. \nTrap: CR 3; +3 melee (1d3 points to all within two adjacent squares); Search (DC 20); (Disable \n\nDevice DC 25). If the iron ring is pulled, the wall section collapses outward.   \nTreasure: In the back of the niche is a fragment of parchment with the name “Argenta.”  It crumbles \n\nto dust when touched.  There is also a small sack with 200 cp in the corner. \n \nSometimes there will be room for several listings of the same type (Entrance Level 29 has three \n\ntraps, for example).  The DM can use any or all of these as desired.  They can all be placed in one area \n(like a triple–trapped box) or can be scattered about the room (a pit trap, a trapped bell cord, and so on).  \nAlthough the keys are a general guide, the DM must still make decisions about how much information to \ngive the party.  For example, in Upper Level 10, the key describes a tub with bath oil pearls in it.  Instead \nof giving the party this information, a DM might describe these as “little colored balls.”  The party would \nhave to experiment to get more information (they are soft and contain a strange, sweet–smelling liquid \nwhen cut open).  A clever party might find out that the “pearls” dissolve in water, and the brightest players \nmay even recognize what they are! \n \n\nPART 3: \nKEY TO THE ENTRANCE LEVEL \n\n1.  The entrance way seems to be impassable.  A massive and foreboding double portcullis blocks the \nentryway of a 30’ wide corridor.  A breeze is gently blowing from the palace corridor and it carries with it \nthe dust of decayed stone and the smell of decaying bodies.  Occasionally sounds of pain, fright, and \nhunger can be heard, but they are far away and sometimes muffled, so that all that may be heard is a \nshort piercing scream and then total silence. \n\nDue to the width of the corridor and the natural lighting (be it sunlight or moonlight), vision is clear to the \nend of the corridor, at which point two openings, both leading south, and also blocked by bars, can be \nseen. \n\nThe party cannot see what is beyond the two openings.  Sounds coming from deep in the palace can \nbe heard every few minutes.  Once inside the party will hear, just beyond the double portcullis, four \nenchanted voices.  One emits a faraway piercing scream that is soon muffled, the second enchanted \nvoice imitates someone in pain, the third one screams in fright and the last one wails in hunger. \n\nTo raise the double portcullis requires a Strength check (DC 21).  Once the portcullis is raised, unless \nthe characters continue to hold it up, 1d4 should be rolled to determine how many rounds it will stay up.  If \na 1 is rolled, the gate will come crashing down almost immediately (allow all characters to get through \n\n\n\nfirst).  There is 1 chance in 10 that a wandering monster will hear the noise and come to investigate (see \nWandering Monster Table).  Otherwise the bars will stay up for as many rounds as the number on the \ndie indicates. \n\nThere is no monster or treasure in this area. \n \n1A.  Two passageways can be seen here.  Each is behind a double portcullis.  The first one leads south, \nwhile the second extends west. \n\nIt will take a Strength check (DC 19) to raise either of these portcullises. \nThere is no monster or treasure in this area. \n\n \n1B.  There are two passageways here blocked by a double portcullis.  One of the passages leads south, \nthe other east.  Beyond 15’, down either passage, vision is impaired and nothing but blackness can be \nseen (this applies to the other passage as well).  The south passage way seems to be drier than the east \none.  The eastern passageway has a hint of moisture in the air and dampness can be felt on the wall just \ninside the portcullis. \n\nThere is no monster or treasure in this area. \n \n1C.  The walls of this room are collapsing.  Moisture clings to everything and purple moss grows \neverywhere throughout the room.  Torches flicker and sputter as if they are not getting enough oxygen to \nburn.  The air feels heavy and hard to breathe.  A sweet smell fills the room and gets stronger as time \npasses. \n\nThe purple moss is a type of plant that thrives on moisture and flesh.  The sweet smell the party has \ndetected is a sleeping gas produced by the plant.  Once the victim is asleep the moss will quickly cover \nthe body and devour it in less than an hour.  It then hides the bones of its dinner by covering them and \nsoon they become indistinguishable from any other normal mound of moss.  Each player will have to \nmake a successful save in order to avoid being affected by the sleep gas.  The purple moss cannot be \nharmed except by normal or magical fire. \n\nThere is no treasure in this area. \n \nPurple Moss: CR ½; 20 hp; SA Sleep; SQ Cover. \n\nSA—Sleep Fort save (DC 11) or sleep. \nSQ—Cover Will cover a Medium–size victim in 4 rounds, –1 round per size less, +2 rounds per size \n\ngreater. \n \n1D.  This huge cave area is filled with the sweet smell of fresh water.  The source is obviously a rather \nlarge gray stone pool of water that almost covers the entire floor of the cavern.  Occasionally bubbles rise \nto the surface of the water, but apart from that the water is quiet.  A small ledge circles one end of the \npool.  This ledge is wide enough for one fully armored person to inch around the pool to the other side \nwhere an opening can be seen. \n\nIf the party disturbs the water, 12 bubbles will rise to the surface to defend their lair.  The bubbles will \nattempt to surprise the party by rising to the surface all at once.  If a bubble manages to successfully \nparalyze someone, it will engulf that victim and then sink back down to the bottom of the pool.  The pool is \n15’ deep in its deepest point, and 4’ deep at its shallowest point.  The victim will suffocate unless \nsomeone manages to kill the enclosing bubble.  If the victim cannot be saved, the bubble will expel the \ndead victim and rise to the surface to attack again.  The body, unless armored, will float to the surface. \n\nStairs lead down the passageway from the pool to a dead end.  This area may be opened up by the \nDM. \n \nBubble (12): CR ¼; Medium–size Aberration; HD ½d8; hp 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2); Init +1; Spd 30 \nft. swim, 10 ft. fly (poor); AC 11 (+1 Dex); Atk +1 melee (1d4 +paralysis, touch); SA Paralysis, Engulf; SQ \nImmunities, Reform; AL N; SV Fort +0, Ref +1, Will +2; Str ––, Dex 13, Con 10, Int ––, Wis 10, Cha 8. \n\nFeats Weapon Finesse (touch). \n\n\n\nSA--Paralysis Fort Save (DC 10) or be paralyzed for 1 hour; Engulf will engulf foes of Medium–size or \nsmaller. \n\nSQ—Immunities Immune to bludgeoning weapons and mind–influencing spells and effects; Reform \nWill reform in 6 hours unless the water in which it dwells is drained away. \n \nTreasure: If the party manages to successfully kill all the bubbles, their treasure may be found at the \ndeepest point of the pool.  A small bag of 133 gold pieces and one silver wolf–head ring (value: 33 gold \npieces) will be found if the pool is searched. \n \n1E. This small rectangular cave opens up at the base of long steep stairs.  Red coarse sand surrounds a \nsmall gray pool of water.  The ledge around the water is wide enough for one fully armored person to walk \nwith ease. \n\nThe sand is colored red, and if the party rinses the sand they will discover that it is normal coarse sand \nbut once dry becomes red again.  The water does not contain any monsters, but if the party examines the \npool carefully, they will find that it is spring fed.  The drain appears to be near the southern end of the \npool.  If this is plugged and the pool is allowed to flood, the adventurers will discover that the cave floor \ngently slopes to the south.  After several hours, a steady stream will appear.  After several days, the \nentire basin at the base of the southern stairs will be completely flooded.  (If the party does block the \ndrain, note it for future reference.) \n \n1F.  This is an empty room.  \n\nThe DM may wish to insert an encounter of his or her own choosing here or stock the room with valueless \nitems designed to waste a party’s time.  This also applies to the other empty rooms provided throughout \nthis module. \n \nDescription: \n \nMonster: \n \nTreasure: \n \nTrap: \n \n2.  Reed pens, dried ink wells, and hundreds of scraps of paper litter this large room.  There are several \nhuge oak tables overturned near the southeast corner.  This room appears to have been some kind of \nstudy, classroom, or library.  There are no books or intact scrolls anywhere to be seen. \n\nHidden behind the tables is a family of five kobolds.  If the party decides to search the room, or they \ndiscover the kobolds, the kobolds will fight.  Otherwise, they will remain hidden until the danger passes.   \n \nKobolds (5): CR 1/6; Small Humanoid (Reptilian); HD ½d8; hp 4, 4, 3, 2, 1; Init +1; Spd 30 ft.; AC 15 (–1 \nsize, +1 Dex, +1 natural, +2 leather); Atk –1 melee (1d6–2, halfspear) or +2 ranged (1d8, light crossbow); \nSQ Darkvision 60 ft, light sensitivity; AL LE; SV Fort +0, Ref +1, Will +2; Str 6, Dex 13, Con 11, Int 10, \nWis 10, Cha 10. \n Skills and Feats Craft (trapmaking) +2, Hide +8, Listen +2, Move Silently +4, Search +2, Spot +2, \nAlertness. \n SQ––Light Sensitivity Suffers a –1 penalty to attack rolls in bright light or within the radius of a \ndaylight spell. \n \nTreasure: Buried in the rubble of the kobolds’ nest are 50 copper pieces. \n \n\n\n\n3. Rotten bags of grain, old brooms, and three decaying beer barrels full of vinegar are all that remain in \nthis shelved room.  It appears to once have been a storeroom.  It is not obvious as to whether the \ninhabitants left the grain and beer because they could not transport them or because they had no choice \nbut to leave them. \n\nIf the players examine the barrels they will discover that one is full of pickled snakes.  If they touch the \nsacks of grain, the material, due to its age, will come off in their hands in small patches.  The grain itself \nhas a horrible smell, as does the vinegar in the barrels. \n\nThere is no monster or treasure in the room. \n \n4. This area was a kitchen.  There are many wooden trenchers, spoons, and knives scattered about the \ntables and floors.  Three large tubs full of water sit on stools near the fireplace.  One is full of green \nfungus.  A pile of grease soaked rags lies in one corner of the room near a keg of dried beans.  Pots and \nother assorted dishes and cooking utensils are also lying strewn about the room and are beyond cleaning \nor repair. \n\nHidden in the rags is a spitting cobra.  It will only attack if disturbed; otherwise it will remain quiet as it is \nsleeping.  The green fungus will leave a horrible, sickening skunk–like smell on whatever comes in \ncontact with it.  The smell will linger for 3–18 days. \n \nCobra (1): CR ½; Small Animal; HD 1d8; hp 3; Init +3 (Dex); Spd 20 ft., 20 ft. climb, 20 ft. swim; AC 17 \n(+1 size, +3 Dex, +3 natural); Atk +3 melee (1d2–2 and poison, bite); SA Poison; SQ Scent; AL N; SV \nFort +2, Ref +5, Will +1; Str 6, Dex 17, Con 11, Int 1, Wis 12, Cha 2. \n Skills and Feats Balance +11, Climb +12, Hide +15, Listen +9, Spot +9, Weapon Finesse (Bite). \n SA––Poison Fort save (DC 11), initial and secondary damage 1d6 Con. \n \nTreasure: A small fungus encrusted gold ring is at the bottom of the fungus.  If the ring is cleaned, \nplayers will discover the initials A. E. S. carved into it.  This ring has no real value. \n \n5. At first it is hard to determine what this room was used for, but after careful observation it becomes \napparent that it once was a dining hall, but now is a complete wreck.  Tables, benches, and stools have \nbeen smashed into hundreds of pieces, torch sconces have been ripped out of the walls, graffiti covers \none wall and garbage is piled about the room in small, stinking heaps.  The remains of several fires can \nbe seen near the center of the room. \n\nLying in wait under a tabletop is a carrion crawler.  It will wait until someone gets close enough for it to \ngrab.  It is not looking for a fight, as it is recovering from battle wounds recently sustained, but it will not \nflee either.  (The carrion crawler was wounded by the dead soldiers that will be found in room EL 7.) \n\nIf the players examine the fire remains carefully they may be able to discern from discarded \ntinderboxes and other tools of orcish make that the fires seem to have been set by orcs.  Any character \nthat is a half–orc will know this, as will any character that has had previous experience with orcs.  \nOtherwise, characters can make Intelligence or Bardic Knowledge checks (DC 15) to determine the origin \nof this equipment.  In addition, the graffiti scrawled on the walls is full of cruel orcish boasts and threats \nrecognizable to any character who can speak and read orcish. \n \nCarrion Crawler (1): CR 1 (reduced due to decreased hp); Large Aberration; HD 3d8+6; hp 5; Spd 30 ft., \n15 ft. climb; AC 17 (–1 size, +2 Dex, +6 natural); Atk +3 melee (×8) (paralysis, tentacle), –2 melee \n(1d4+1, bite); Face 5 ft by 10 ft; Reach 5 ft.; SA Paralysis; SQ Scent; AL N; SV Fort +3, Ref +3, Will +5; \nStr 14, Dex 15, Con 14, Int 1, Wis 15, Cha 6. \n Skills and Feats Climb +10, Listen +6, Spot +6, Alertness. \n SA––Paralysis Fort save (DC 13) or be paralyzed for 2d6 minutes. \n \nTreasure: One of the bits of wood lying on the floor is actually a wand of secret door detection with 7 \ncharges left (of course, the players will not know how many uses the wand has or exactly what it is).  A \nSearch check (DC 18) is required to find the wand.  In the process, a ring of what appears to be jailers’ \nkeys will be found.  There are 6 keys on the ring, each exactly alike.  These keys have no cash value but \nwill open the cells located at EL 32. \n\n\n\n \n6. Many dusty, musty, smelly bedrolls provide the furniture for this room that was once a barracks.  Six 3’ \nfootlockers are leaning sideways against the west wall and are covered in several inches of dust.  \nOutlines of weapons and shields can be seen on the wall indicating that at one time the walls sported the \noccupant’s tools of the trade as decorations for the otherwise barren room.  The room is very large. \n\nIf the party decides to search this room, roll for a wandering monster only once using the Wandering \nMonster Table.  No other monster may be found while in this area. \n \nTreasure: A Search check (DC 16) will uncover three strange gold coin–like octagons.  These octagons \ncan be used to open a secret compartment in the base of a statue in area EL 14.  If the octagons are \nsold, their value will be between 10 and 100 gold pieces each. \n \n7. This room contains the remains of bunks, bedrolls, round oaken tables, stools, benches, and dead \nsoldiers which have been beheaded.  Along the north wall is a line of 6 heads. \n\nThere are no intact weapons left in the room, and all the bodies have apparently been searched \nthoroughly, leaving nothing of value on them.  Upon closer examination, the players will notice the \ninsignia on the uniforms of the soldiers.  It resembles a wolf's head with a battlement and ball between the \nears, two slanted eyes, an arrow where the nose should be, and a lightning bolt on the arrow.  As the \nparty searches the room, roll for a wandering monsters.  If on the first roll none was indicated roll again.  \nOn the last roll if one was indicated the wandering monster will be two female rogues: \n \nCandella, female human (20) Rog2: CR 2; Medium–size Humanoid (Human); HD 2d6+4; hp 12; Init +7 \n(Dex, Improved Initiative); Spd 30 ft.; AC 13 (+3 Dex); Atk +2 melee (1d6+1, short sword); SA Sneak \nAttack +1d6; SQ Evasion; AL CN; SV Fort +2, Ref +6, Will +2; Str 12, Dex 17, Con 15, Int 15, Wis 13, \nCha 14. \n\nSkills and Feats Appraise +6, Balance +6, Bluff +7, Climb +5, Disable Device +6, Escape Artist +7, \nHide +4, Listen +4, Move Silently +7, Open Lock +7, Pick Pocket +10, Search +5, Spot +4, Tumble +6, \nImproved Initiative, Skill Focus (pick pocket). \n\nSA—Sneak Attack  does and extra 1d6 damage when applicable. \nSQ--Evasion when allowed a Reflex save for half damage, takes no damage instead. \nPossessions 15 gp, 7 sp, 21 cp, poisoned dagger, strand of pearls (600 gp). \n\n \nDuchess, female human (18) Rog2: CR 2; Medium–size Humanoid (Human); HD 2d6+8; hp 14; Init +7 \n(Dex, Improved Initative); Spd 30 ft.; AC 13 (+3 Dex); Atk +1 melee (1d6, short sword); SA Sneak Attack \n+1d6; SQ Evasion; AL CN; SV Fort +4, Ref +6, Will +2; Str 11, Dex 16, Con 18, Int 12, Wis 15, Cha 15. \n\nSkills and Feats Appraise +4, Balance +5, Deciper Script +5, Disable Device +5, Hide +6, Intimidate \n+6, Jump +2, Listen +8, Move Silently +7, Open Lock +7, Pick Pocket +6, Search +7, Sense Motive +7, \nSpot +6, Alertness, Improved Initiative. \n\nSA—Sneak Attack  does and extra 1d6 damage when applicable. \nSQ--Evasion when allowed a Reflex save for half damage, takes no damage instead. \nPossessions 15 gp, 7 sp, 21 cp, poisoned dagger, 8 sprigs of wolfsbane. \n\n \nBoth women have an above average appearance and will attempt to use it to their benefit.  They will \npretend to be young inexperienced fighters in search of adventure, fame and fortune, but mostly fortune.  \nCandella is the spokesman of the two women. \n\nThese two rogues will be friendly towards the party, not acting hostile if they win the initiative.  They \nwill politely ask to join the party, saying that they are not quite as tough or prepared for adventuring as \nthey had originally thought themselves to be.  Duchess will stress her desire to accompany them, saying \nshe fears that she and her companion have made a grave error in attempting to venture into the palace \nruins by themselves, especially after seeing the strange 3 headed monsters they have managed to flee \nfrom so far. \n\nThese two rogues may be used by the DM as NPCs (non–player characters) or as a normal dungeon \nencounter. \n \n\n\n\nTreasure: Both thieves will have normal dungeon supplies, weapons and thieves tools. \n \n8. Wind whistles softly through this dark damp cave carrying with it a musky smell.  In the entrance way of \nthe cave can be seen two sets of animal chains.  Straw is scattered about the floor, along with jagged \nbones. \n\nIf the party opts to enter the cave, they will soon find themselves face to face with a very hungry and very \nyoung bear cub.  It appears to have been abandoned by its mother though there is a 1% chance per turn \nshe will return.  If the players offer it food (meat) it will eat it gladly, but warily watch and growl at the \nplayers while it devours the food. \n\nIf the party captures the cub they will be forced to sell it as they will find that it is too big, too wild, and \ntoo hungry for them to afford to keep.  Its value on the open market is between 200 and 400 gold pieces.  \nHowever, the DM may wish to have the cub auctioned off in a bazaar, or can allow the players to have it \ntamed and trained at a great cost.  Training can be done only by a skilled animal trainer and will cost from \n200–700 gp and take from 4–24 weeks.  This will allow the DM to continue the game into the city. \n \nBrown bear cub (1): CR 1; Small Animal; HD 2d8+2; hp 9; Init +1 (Dex); Spd 20ft. (speed); AC 13 (+1 \nsize, +1 Dex, +1 natural); Atk +1 melee (1d3, claw); AL N; SV Fort +4, Ref +1, Will +0; Str 10, Dex 12, \nCon 12, Int 2, Wis 10, Cha 5. \n \n9. This elongated hexagonal room is littered with smelly, moldy, red towels.  There is also a lot of dried up \nsoft pink soap in broken blue ceramic containers, decorated with romantic scenes of mermaids swimming \nabout proud ships and singing songs to the sailors.  The beautiful marble floors are white, veined in black \nand gold.  Each of the 6 walls is decorated with ornately carved wooden towel racks and copper torch \nsconces, which are now tarnished due to lack of care.  A lovely bench of black marble with white and gold \nstreaks occupies the center of the room.  A faded red cushion, now ruined by dry rot, lies beside the \nbench. \n\nHidden in a towel under the bench is a gold colored key on a thin golden chain.  Finding the key requires \na Search check (DC 17) unless they specifically state that they are looking under the bench, at which \npoint they will discover the key.  This key will open the secret door in room EL 12. \n \nTreasure: If it is sold, the key and chain together will only bring 1 gold and 6 silver pieces. \n \n10. In this room, which is shaped exactly like the last one, is a large pool.  It appears to be filled with clear \nwater.  The walls of this room are lavishly decorated with murals of water nymphs, ponds with long reeds \nextending upwards to the sun, and brave hunters stalking water birds.  Here, as in the last room, are \nmore moldy rotten towels.  There are also seven delicately carved vials of scented bath oils, and a rather \nlarge peacock feather fan, now rotted, which is propped up in one corner. \n\nIf the party examines the pool closely, they will discover what appears to be a rather large diamond \nembedded in the centerof the pool.  The gem is actually the eye of the diger, an amoebic monster that \nseeks rock or stone areas in which to camouflage itself as a pool.  It is incapable of attacking anyone or \nanything unless the victim enters the diger’s ‘pool,’ at which time it may attempt to paralyze him or her.  If \nthe character fails to save, he or she will fall into the liquid–like body of the diger and drown.  If the victim \nremains in the diger’s ‘pool’ for the 48 turns, the monsters will completely digest the victim, and no \nremains, including metal, will be found. \n\nNote the false door and secret door. \n \nDiger (1): CR 2; Large Ooze; HD 2d10+19; hp 30; Init –3 (Dex); Spd 5 ft., 30 ft. fly (poor), 40 ft. swim; AC \n11 (–1 size, –3 Dex, +5 natural); Atk +6 melee (paralysis, touch; Face 15 ft. by 15 ft.; SA Paralysis; SQ \nLimited Flight, Ooze; AL N; SV Fort +2, Ref –2, Will –5; Str 21, Dex 4, Con 15, Int ––, Wis 1, Cha 1. \n\nSA--Paralysis Fort save (DC 13) or be paralyzed for 1d6 rounds. \nSQ—Limited Flight Can only fly for 1+½ Con rounds before it must rest for three times as long as it \n\nflew. \n \n\n\n\nTreasure: The vials of oils are worth a gold piece each, and the feather fan, due to its condition, only 5 \ncopper pieces.   \n \n11. Upon entering this room, the first thing noticed is a small, pink marble pedestal about dwarf size in \nheight.  Any light entering the room will gleam off of a small object atop the pedestal.  The object is silver \nin color.  Other than the pedestal the room seems to be empty. \n\nWhen a character gets within one foot of the pedestal, the silver pendant on top of the pedestal will begin \nto radiate a silver glow that will illuminate the entire room.  After one round, hysterical laughter will seem \nto come from the pendant. \n \nTreasure (cursed): Anyone within a 10’ radius of it must make a Will save (DC 15) or be affected as by a \nTasha’s hideous laughter spell.   They fall into a fit of uncontrollable laughter that will last 3 rounds or until \nthe pendant is removed from the pedestal.  Any character attempting to remove the pendant must also \nmake a save or else be likewise stricken.  The second character is allowed a +2 on his or her save, as is \nanyone else who tries.  However, the pendant can only affect three people at any given time.  All others \nwill be immune until there are no longer three people in its area of effect.  Once the pendant has been \nsuccessfully removed, the stricken character will no longer be affected by the pendant, and all laughter \nwill cease.  Characters who were affected by the pendant will lose 2 points of Strength and 1 point from \ntheir Constitution for 2–8 rounds.  The pendant has no sale value. \n Caster Level: 10th; Prerequisites: Craft Wondrous Item, Tasha’s hideous haughter; Market Price: \n500gp. \n \n12.  This hexagonal room, much like the other ones, is decorated with mosaic tiles.  The mosaic covers \nthe entire room, the walls, the floor, and ceiling.  The scenes are of a red dragon mounted by a man in \nsilver and blue armor giving chase to a young maiden wearing a silver gown and a silver and ruby \ncoronet.  Another scene depicts elves playing in the woods while a red dragon watches them from his \nhiding place behind two tall pines.  On one wall is a pool of bright blue water with a shimmering diamond \nfloating on a lily paid, and several mermaids swimming and splashing each other near it.  The design on \nthe floor shows the maiden, man and dragon curled up asleep around a key hole. \n\nOnce the party has entered the room, if they examine the murals, the keyhole in the floor will emit a blue \nwhite glow and will last until a key is placed into it. \n \nTrap: CR 5; Search (DC 20); Disable Device (DC 25); If the players use one of the jailer's keys (providing \nthey found them) or any key other than the gold one from EL 9, a 5’×5’×1’ stone slab will fall from the \nceiling over the spot where the keyhole is located.  Characters within that area must make a Reflex save \n(DC 15) to avoid being hit by the stone.  Any character caught by the stone will suffer 2d6 points of \ndamage. \n \nIf the golden colored key is placed in the keyhole, another keyhole will appear on the east wall.  The \nsecond keyhole is opened by the golden key also.  Once placed in the lock and turned, the wall, keyhole, \nand key will vanish.  A long silver sword––glowing with a bright blue–white light, suspended in mid air––\nwill appear in their place.  If a character reaches out to touch the sword, a fully armored man (the one \ndepicted in the murals), will appear beside it, take the sword and attack the person who was attempting to \ntake the sword.  The man is an illusion generated by a shadow conjuring spell, and will disappear after 4 \nrounds.  Characters who interact with the illusion are allowed a Will save (DC 17) to recognize it as \nshadowy.  However, characters hit by the illusion will believe that they have actually sustained damage \nand will feel “hurt,” though no damage was actually taken.  Once the illusion has disappeared, the sword \nwill drop to the floor, still glowing, as it was when the characters fast saw it.  All characters will \nimmediately realize that they took no damage, and characters who may have been “killed” will discover \nthat they are actually alive and were only asleep. \n\nIf all the party members are “killed,” they will wake up a short time later.  The illusion will be gone and \nthe glowing sword will be lying on the floor.  The illusion will not reappear if they take the sword before \nleaving the room.  If the characters decide to touch the sword again, nothing will happen to them and the \nsword will “feel good” in their hands. \n\n\n\n \nShadow Conjured Warrior (1): CR 1;Medium–size “Humanoid”; HD 1d8; hp 7; Init +0; Spd 30 ft.; AC 18 \n(+8 full plate); Atk +2 melee (1d8+1, longsword); AL N; SV Fort +#, Ref +#, Will +#; Str 11, Dex 11, Con \n11, Int 11, Wis 11, Cha 11. \n\nPossessions Longsword +1. \n \nTreasure: The sword will always glow when not sheathed.  There is no sheath for it in the room, nor will it \nfit into a sheath not specifically designed for it.  It magically glows, and is a +1 weapon. \n \n13.  Room Description: \n\nMonster: \n \nTreasure: \n \nTrap: \n \n14.  This open area is a small worship alcove.  On a raised platform along the western wall is a beautifully \ncarved statue of a woman holding a small girl child in her lap.  The woman is smiling down at the child, \nwho plays with a small ball clutched in her hands.  The inscription on the base of the statue reads “The \nsecret treasure of one’s heart can be found in love.” \n\nA small opening beneath the inscription is the lock to open the compartment in the base of the statue.  \nOne of the gold coin–like octagons found in room EL 6 will open it if inserted into the opening.  Once \nopened, a scroll case will be found, and in it a fragment of a verse written in silver ink on vellum \nparchment. \n \n“I came, and what did my eyes behold? \nA maiden fair with hair of gold. \nHer face, aglow by which the sun is shamed. \nMy steed, a dragon, her innocence did tame. \nHer heart, a gem with many facets . . .” \n \nMonster: \n \n15.  In this small and once luxuriously decorated semicircular room is a tiny 3’×3’ alcove in which stands a \nstatue of a young girl with arm outstretched.  The area seems peaceful. \n\nTrap: CR 1; Search (20); Disable Device (DC 20); If the secret door is opened it will trigger a mechanism, \nwhich will pour down 200 cp worth of golden glitter upon the first person to step through.  This glitter will \nstick to all exposed skin, hair, leather, and cloth.  It cannot be removed except by oil or animal fat.  If \nplayers attempt to wash it off with wine or water all they will succeed in doing is rearranging it a little.  The \nonly way to avoid, this trap is to place a weight of at least 60 pounds on the pressure plate just inside the \nsecret door.  This will set off the trap, and the glitter will stick to the floor, instead.  The glitter will glow in \nthe dark, allowing all monsters a +2 to Spot checks against the character and negating any chance of \ncatching monsters flat–footed. \n \n16.  The first thing seen upon entering this room is a plaque that reads “All that glitters is not gold.”  There \nis also a small fountain of water in one corner and both the north and south walls are covered by arrases.  \nOne arras has a scene of a young maiden with golden hair sitting on a silver throne.  Upon her head rests \na coronet of silver and rubies, and in her hand a scepter of silver topped by a very large blood red ruby.  \nThe arras show a warrior in blue and silver armor resting casually in a wooden arm chair decorated with \ncarvings.  His feet are propped up on a stool. \n\n \n17. Four statues dominate the room, one in each corner.  Each one is of a young girl in a different pose.  \nBetween the two statues on the east wall is a kneeling bench, and on it rests an open book.  Plush rugs \n\n\n\nthat are still in fair condition cover the floor. \n\nThe book is the diary of Lady Argenta.  It simply tells of the fighter in silver and blue armor coming to her \nhome, winning her love and then marrying her.  It stops after the fourth day of their marriage.  It does \nmention “My Lady’s Heart” being somewhere in the living quarters of the palace hidden in a teak wood \njewel case. \n \nMonster: \n \n18.  This area seems to have been in some kind of explosion or earthquake.  Rubble covers the floor.  \nOccasionally whimpers like those from a puppy can be heard.  They frequently start only to stop a few \nseconds later. \n\nThe whimpering is only the wind blowing through the rubble. \n \nMonster: \n \n19.  Room Description: \n\nMonster: \n \nTreasure: \n \n20.  This very small chamber is more of a passageway than a room.  It is very cramped and there are \nseveral sets of empty shelves on the walls. \n\nTrap: CR 1; no attack roll necessary (1d6); Reflex save (DC 20) avoids; Search (DC 20); Disable Device \n(DC 20); The pit trap in the floor of this storage passage will be activated by the first person to step onto \nit, and triggered by the second one who steps onto it.  Once triggered, the floor will swing open and drop \nwhatever is on it into a 10’ deep pit.  The cover then will swing back up and lock shut.  Anyone falling into \nthe pit will take 1d6 points of damage. \n\nIf the first person who walks across the trap door is at the other side before the second one tries, only \nthe second one will fall in, otherwise both will fall in. \n\nAfter one round, small openings will appear in the walls, and oil will pour out into the pit.  The oil will \ncontinue to spill forth until it lies 1” deep over the entire surface area of the floor.  As soon as this occurs, \nanother wall opening will appear and an unlit torch will fall onto the oil.  (When the palace was occupied, \nthe torch would have been lit.) \n\nCharacters who are not trapped in the pit will be unable to open it by any means other than using the \nrelease mechanisms hidden inside secret compartments on the inside of either doorway (Search DC 20 \nto find).  (Note that any character covered in glitter from the secret door at room EL 15, who has fallen \ninto this pit, will discover that the glitter is coming off due to the oil.) \n \n21. Room Description: \n\nMonster: \n \nTrap: \n \nTreasure:  \n \n22.  This room is cluttered with many objects large and small. \n\nIf any light source is brought into the room, eerie shadows begin to dance wildly about.  One shadow, \nlurking in the corner, appears to be human or humanlike. \n\nThe humanlike form in the corner is actually a dressmakers’ dummy.  The room is filled with old bolts \nof cloth so rotten that merely brushing up against them causes them to disintegrate into thousands of little \npieces. \n \n\n\n\nTreasure: Also hidden in the room in a pincushion ball is a small delicate platinum needle (value 15 gp) \nbrought to the Lady Argenta from a faraway land.  Metal needles are very rare, and platinum ones are \neven rarer. \n \nMonster: \n \n23.  Sand covers almost the entire floor of this once lavishly decorated room.  Glints of silver may be seen \nin the sand near the center of the room. \n\nIf the party searches the sand, the silvery glint will prove to be strands of dancing bells on small delicate \nchains. \n \nTrap: CR 1; no attack roll necessary (1d6); Reflex save (DC 20) avoids; Search (DC 25); Disable Device \n(DC 20);; There is a 10’ deep pit near the center of the room.  Since the trap door is sand covered the \nSearch DC to detect it is 25.  Anyone falling in will take 1d6 points of damage. \n\nAlso trapped in the pit is a baric who fell into it and is now nearly dead from starvation.  Due to the \nfact that it is half starved, it has taken 6 points of subdual damage, and is fatigued (operating at –2 to \nStrength and Dexterity; see pg. 86 in the DMG for rules regarding starvation). \n \nBaric (1): CR ½ (reduced due to weakness); Small Beast; HD 2d10; hp 5; Init +0; Spd 40 ft.; AC 12 (+1 \nsize, +1 natural); Atk +1 melee (×2) (1d3, claw) or +2 melee (1d8, bite); SQ Scent; AL N; SV Fort +3, Ref \n+3, Will +0; Str 10, Dex 11, Con 11, Int 4, Wis 10, Cha 10. \n\nSkills Listen +3, Spot +3, Wilderness Lore +3. \n \nTreasure: Hidden in the sand in the northwestern corner of the room are a small sack of mixed coins (10 \ngp, 8 sp and 9 cp) and a jade ring with dragons carved into it (value 250 gp).  The ring is not magical.  \nThe dancing bells have a value of 2 gp. \n \n \n24. Upon entering this rectangular room, the first thing that will be noticed are the arrases hanging on all \nfour walls and the many couches circled around a 5’ wide decorative wheel that is painted on the floor.  \nVarious pillows of many sizes (now musty and falling apart) are scattered randomly about the room.  \nCrushed and punctured wine goblets are piled into one corner of the room.  In another corner of this room \nstands a small lap harp that has no strings.  Candleholders, a few of which are very decorative, sit on \nsmall tables, almost the size of stools, near each couch. \n\nThe arrases are as rotten as most other materials so far encountered.  The couches are made of marble \nand have been cemented to the floor.   \n \nMonster: \n \nTreasure: The seven decorative candleholders are made of silver (value 50 gp each).  The harp in the \ncorner is a harp of charming.  See the New Magic Items section at the end of this module for more \ninformation on this item. \n \n25. A statue of a small dragon readying for flight is leaning against the northeastern corner of this partly \ncarved out room.  A set of stairs going up is in the north wall.  The whole room appears to have been cut \nfrom the living rock, instead of built from rocks brought in from mountain quarries.  This area does not \nappear to be made from marble. \n\nThere is a false doorway in the west wall placed there to trap intruders. \n \nTrap: CR 2; +8 ranged (1 plus nitharit poison, Fort save DC 11, 0 Con/3d6 Con); Search (DC 22); Disable \nDevice (DC 20);  If the iron ring is grasped a poisoned needle will spring out and pierce the hand of the \ngrasper.  Due to the age of the venom the Fort save to resist it has decreased by –2. \n \nMonster: \n\n\n\n \nTreasure:  \n \n26. An overturned oaken table and three benches are all that remain in this small guardroom.  The floor is \nthickly covered in dust, and nothing seems to have disturbed it in a long time.  There is a large sack in the \nsoutheast corner.  Large bloodstains are smeared on the floor beside it. \n\nWithin the sack are three human skulls, a dagger, a dagger blade, and 11 sp.  There are many vile–\nlooking but harmless spiders living in the skulls.  Under the sack is a bloody finger joint.  It appears to be \nfresh. \n \nMonster: \n \n27.  This large rectangular room contains many implements of torture.  An iron maiden hangs in one \ncorner.  Rusted, long–neglected branding irons lie scattered among the filthy bloodstained straw.  \nAssorted sizes and lengths of chain encircle several skeletons hanging limply against the walls.  Small \nwooden cages hang from the ceiling.  Caught in the door of one is a bit of what appears to be a tattered \nnightgown.  Several mice peer out of holes and cracks in the gray stone walls. \n\nThe room is empty when the party enters.  After one round, a crazed old man, Travis with a meat cleaver \nwill come up the stairs from the south and appear in the doorway.  He will laugh insanely and then attack \nthe closest person to him.  Travis, an old crazed warrior, will scream at the players saying that he knew \nthey could not resist his treasure.  No one could, he laughs, not even his companions.  He knows they \nhave come to steal his great treasure, and so they all must die just as others before them.  He will attack \nuntil either he or the characters are dead.  He will neither surrender nor allow himself to be captured. \n\nNo treasure can be found on him or in the room. \n \nTravis, male human (47) War1: CR 1; Medium–size Humanoid (Human); HD 1d8+4; hp 9; Init +3 (Dex); \nSpd 30 ft.; AC 13 (+3 Dex); Atk +4 melee (1d4+3, meat cleaver); AL CN (Completely Nuts); SV Fort +6, \nRef +3, Will –1; Str 17, Dex 17, Con 18, Int 13, Wis 9, Cha 8. \n\nSkills Climb +7, Intimidate +3, Jump +7, Ride +2, Swim +2. \nPossessions  Meat cleaver. \n\n \n28.  A horrible smell like rotting carcasses can be detected beyond the door of this room. \n\nOnce opened, mounds of rotten, decayed bodies of unlucky adventurers can be seen covering almost \nevery inch of the floor.  The sight is gruesome to behold, and characters must make a Fort save (DC 10) \nor they will not be able to enter the room without becoming ill for 1d6+1 rounds from the smell and gory \nsight.  The bodies have all been thoroughly searched prior to the party finding them and there is nothing \nof value to be found. \n \n29. A small pallet of fresh straw lies near the northwestern corner of this room.  A wooden trencher, a pair \nof eating knives and a pewter wine goblet rest neatly on a table in the center of the room.  Several old \ntapestries have been carelessly hung on the walls, and bits of fur and other types of floor covering form a \nmakeshift rug.  A burning lantern hangs over the table. \n\nThis is the room where Travis lives.  On the east wall, behind the tapestry is the peephole he uses to spy \nout into the hallway. \n \nTreasure: Hidden underneath the pallet, protected by a loose stone in the floor, is a small wooden case.  \nThis case contains Travis’ personal treasure; 2 rubies (300 gp each), 1 large emerald (2000 gp), a gold \nwedding ring with the initials D and B carved in the shape of a heart on the inside (10 gp), and a gem–\nstudded throwing dagger +2 (the plus only applies if the dagger is thrown at an opponent; its value is 400 \ngp).  The valuables he has removed from his victims are hidden in room EL 32D. \n\nNote: The throwing dagger is magical, although it only has the +2 bonus when thrown. \n \nTrap: \n\n\n\n \n30.  Directly across from the northern door is a huge wooden table still in good condition.  Behind it is a \nhuge ornately carved wooden chair.  On the table is a candle sconce, a feathered quill, a blank scroll, and \na string of colored wooden beads. \n\nTravis kept this room in good shape.  He used it to hold ‘court’ if he decided to impress some of his \nvictims.  The paper scroll, pen, and candle sconce are still in good condition and were obviously used by \nTravis when he passed judgment on the accused.  However, the beads will be a mystery to the \nadventurers.  These beads are message beads used by the dead soldiers found in EL 7.  The message \ndepicted on the beads must be determined by the DM. \n \nTrap: \n \nTrap: \n \nTrap: \n \n31.  This rather large room has been swept clean.  No dirt or dust can be found.  The room is empty of all \nfurnishings. \n\nTravis, it appears was a very clean man.  All the rooms he claimed as his territory were used for a specific \nreason or kept completely clean. \n \n32.  This area is a group of jail cells.  A few of them contain skeletons or corpses chained to the walls. \n\nAll the cells are locked.  The set of jailer’s keys mentioned earlier (EL 5) will open all the cells.  Note that \nthis whole area would be an excellent place to hide monsters and treasure. \n\nCell D: In this cell are 2 large marmoset monkeys who will attack anyone who enters the room \n(except Travis).  The marmosets stand 5’ high when erect; and have 7’ long tails that they use not only for \nbalance, but for attacking.  The tails are tipped by sharp furry spikes.  They are protecting the treasure \nthat Travis has collected from his victims.  All these items are locked in three large metal chests. \n \nMarmoset, Giant (2): CR 1; Medium–size Animal; HD 3d8+3; hp 13, 13; Init +2 (Dex); Spd 60 ft., 30 ft. \nclimb; AC 15 (+2 Dex, +3 natural); Atk +2 melee (×2) (1d6, claw) or +2 melee (1d8, bite), +2 melee (1d4, \ntail); AL N; SV Fort +1, Ref +2, Will +0; Str 11, Dex 15, Con 13, Int 3, Wis 11, Cha 11. \n\nSkills Climb +11, Hide +5, Listen +3, Move Silently +5, Spot +3. \n \nTreasure: The first chest contains a large mixture of coins of several different realms totaling 1000 cp, \n400 sp, and 200 gp.  The second chest holds a variety of jewelry, mostly artificial or costume, worth 500 \ngp.  The last one is filled with swords, daggers, and helms.  Only one of the swords is magical, a short \nsword +1.  It is indistinguishable from the rest of the swords unless a detect magic is cast on them. \n \n33.  This small cave is filled with ornate and delicately carved life–size statues of different men and \nwomen.  Many candles and other burnt offerings lie before each of the statues.  Marble benches form a \ncircle in the center of the room. \n\nThe statues represent unknown gods and goddesses.   \n \nMonster: \n \nTrap: \n \nTreasure: Hidden in one of the statue’s arms is a wand of light.  Players will have to make a Search \ncheck (DC 18) on the statues in order to find the wand.  The wand has only 3 charges left, and looks the \nsame as any other wand. \n \n34. A single statue of embracing lovers dominates this cave.  Dead vines and other plant life hang loosely \n\n\n\nto the rough walls.  They were originally grown in clay pots, but have not received care for a long time.  \nThe floor is worn smooth. \n\nNothing of value can be found in this area.  The smoothness of the floor is due to the hundreds of feet \nthat have trekked in and out of this cave over the previous centuries. \n \nMonster: \n \nTrap: \n \n35. This huge cave is filled with stalactites and stalagmites covered in a shimmering pink glow.  The \nstalactites and stalagmites in many places have formed into one single column.  It is very difficult to move \nthrough this area as the stalactites and stalagmites are very close together.  In some places they almost \nform walls. \n\nIf the players decide to investigate this area, they will discover that the northern section of the cave is \nfairly free of stalagmites and stalactites.  In this empty space stands a statue of a beautiful woman \nbeckoning to any who approach. \n \nTrap (50 ft. deep, water filled): CR 2; no attack roll necessary (no damage, but risks drowning); Reflex \nsave (DC 20) avoids; Search (DC 20); Disable Device (DC 20); Anyone who manages to make their way \nthrough the maze of stalactites and stalagmites may fall into a pit trap that is placed at the base of the \nstatue.  This 50’ deep pit is filled with stagnant water. \n \nMonster: \n \nTreasure: \n \n36. Behind the bars of the entrance to this cave pitch black water can be seen, as well as a glint of gold \nfrom time to time.  Hot winds seem to come from this barred area.  The dampness on the walls is \napparent from the droplets that fall to the floor.  Moisture fills the air and clings to clothes, skin, and hair.  \nThe floor is slick from the warm water. \n\nAll characters must make Dexterity checks (DC 12) due to the slipperiness of the floor or fall during the \nfirst round in the room.  Thereafter they are safe, as they will grow accustomed to the wetness, though \nnot to the heat.  Once they have managed to lift the portcullis, requiring a Strength check (DC 22) due to \nits rusted condition, it will stay up. \n \n37.  This appears to be an empty room. \n\nThere is a secret door on the north wall of this room leading to a flight of stairs going down to EL 38.  A \nSearch check (DC 20) is required to find the door. \n \nMonster: \n \nTreasure: \n \nTrap: \n \n38.  This appears to be an empty room. \n\nThere is a trap door in the ceiling that leads up to UL 1. \n \nMonster: \n \nTreasure: \n \nTrap: \n\n\n\n \nPART 4: KEY TO THE UPPER LEVEL  \n\n1.  This watch tower room has 6 windows overlooking the surrounding lands.  A trap door is in the center \nof the floor.  A rope ladder lies to one side of it.  Several arrows are embedded into the door, and a \nbroken bow and a sword lay beside it.  There is a door in the east wall. \n\nAfter a round the players will hear scuffling and fighting noises from the other side of the east wall door.  \nPhrases like “Come on Briardoor, I got her,” “no Joshua, not him” and “take that you filthy worm,” will be \nheard intermixed with the other noises.  If the players open the door to investigate, bright light will fill the \nhallway, and all that will be seen are three swords fighting each other as if by themselves.  It is a major \nimage, Will save (DC 16) to disbelieve if interacted with, placed there by the palace wizard to frighten \nintruders who may decide to enter through the tower.  The illusion will not be dispelled by touch, since it is \npermanent, but any character that makes her Will save will recognize them as mere illusions.  The trap \ndoors leads down to room EL 38. \n \n2.  This partly intact ancient laboratory holds the remains of several experiments, small scraps of paper, \nbeakers, and a variety of other equipment spilled across onto two large oaken tables.  A beautiful life–size \ngreen crystal statue of a male warrior with shield stands in the northeast corner.  A polishing cloth is \ndraped over its shield.  An empty bookcase is leaning against the north wall, and a destroyed bookcase \nlies on the floor near the south wall. \n\nThe crystal warrior is actually an animated statue and was placed here long ago.  It still serves its \npurpose: to defend the lab from anyone who enters.   \n \nCrystal Warrior (animated stone statue) (1): CR 2; Medium–size Construct; HD 2d10; hp 11; Init +0; \nSpd 30 ft.; AC 14 (+4 natural); Atk +2 melee (1d6+1, slam); SQ Hardness 5, Construct; AL N; SV Fort +0, \nRef +0, Will –5; Str 12, Dex 10, Con ––, Int ––, Wis 1, Cha 1. \n\nSQ—Construct Immune to mind–influencing effects, poison, disease, and similar effects.  Not subject \nto critical hits, subdual damage, ability damage, energy drain, or death from massive damage. \n \nTreasure: Three scraps of paper from the pile on the tables contain 1st level arcane spells (spells to be \ndetermined by the DM; roll on the 1st level arcane scrolls table on page 200 of the DMG.). \n \n3.  This is a deserted room.  It is now empty. \n\nThis room once held stores of various sorts but has long since been cleaned out. \n \nMonster: \n \nTreasure: \n \n4.  A plain, single bed, and a huge wooden and metal desk dominate this sparsely furnished bedchamber.  \nA broom lies in one corner near a pile of dirt.  A tattered pair of silk bedroom slippers lie at the floor of the \nplain bed.  A small chest of drawers with attached mirror has been turned over. \n\nHiding under the bed is a small black cat.  It will appear as a harmless domesticated creature, but is \nactually an enchanted great cat and can become a panther once every other hour for 10 rounds.  When in \nsmall cat form it is harmless.  It will be up to the DM to keep track of the elapsed time and determine at \nwhat times the cat will transform itself.  Although it is possible for characters to gain this animal as a pet, \neither through spells or other abilities, it cannot become a druid’s animal companion or a familiar; the \nbizarre enchantment upon it negates any chance for the success of such magic. \n \nEnchanted Cat (1): CR ¼; Tiny Animal; HD ½d8; hp 2; Init +2 (Dex); Spd 30 ft.; AC 14 (+2 size, +2 Dex); \nAtk +2 melee (×2) (1d2–4, claw), –1 melee (1d3–4, bite); Face 2½ ft. by 2½ ft; Reach 0 ft.; SV Fort +2, \nRef +4, Will +1; Str 3, Dex 15, Con 10, Int 2, Wis 12, Cha 7. \n\nSkills and Feats Balance +10, Climb +5, Hide +17, Listen +4, Move Silently +9, Spot +4, Weapon \nFinesse (claw, bite). \n\n\n\n \nEnchanted Cat, as panther (1): CR 2; Medium–size Animal; HD 3d8+6; hp 16; Init +4 (Dex); Spd 40 ft., \n20 ft. climb; AC 15 (+4 Dex, +1 natural); Atk +6 melee (1d6+3, bite) or +1 melee (×2) (1d3+1, claw); SA \nPounce, Improved Grab, Rake 1d3+1; SQ Scent; AL N; SV Fort +5, Ref +7, Will +2; Str 16, Dex 19, Con \n15, Int 2, Wis 12, Cha 6. \n\nSkills and Feats Balance +12, Climb +11, Hide +9, Listen +6, Move Silently +9, Spot +6, Weapon \nFinesse (bite, claw). \n\nSA—Pounce If the panther leaps upon a foe during the first round of combat, it can make a full attack \neven if it has already taken a move action; Improved Grab To use this ability, the panther must hit with its \nbite attack.  If it gets a hold it can rake; Rake A panther that gets a hold can make two rake attacks (+6 \nmelee) with its hind legs for 1d3+1 damage each.  If the panther pounces on an opponent, it can also \nrake. \n \nTreasure: Sewn into the mattress of the bed are 50 gold coins and 3 oval shaped rubies worth 70 gp \neach. \n \n5. This is a deserted room.  It is empty. \n\nThis room once held supplies and stores of various sorts but has long since been emptied. \n \nMonster: \n \nTreasure: \n \n6. A huge, ornate, once lavishly decorated double canopy bed is directly across from the set of double \ndoors.  The bedposts resemble vines, nymphs, and birds all intertwined.  The bed is covered in dusty, dull \nred velvet.  Arrases line three of the walls with lovely and peaceful scenes of maidens riding on unicorns, \nplaying in still pools that abound with plant life, and singing under starry skies lighted by a full moon.  To \neither side of the door is a large hand carved chest of drawers, both with mirrors that are veined in silver.  \nA small cushioned chair and matching footstool are at the end of the bed.  On the footstool is a small \nmake–up palette and pestle. \n\nThis was Lady Argenta’s room.  It has remained untouched by man or monster since the day she left it.  \nThe furniture and cloth here as well as in the rest of the palace is rotten and of no value.  All the drawers \nhave been emptied; and no clues or other information can be gained.   \n\nThe view from the windows is into an overgrown garden. \n \nTreasure: The make–up palette is enameled in gold and was used for crushing colored powders for eye \nmake–up (1000 gp). \n \n7. Several chairs and tables circle the fireplace in this room.  A worn rug lies rolled up in one corner, and \n3 knitting baskets sit beside it.  On a small table near the fireplace is a small teacup and saucer.  Hanging \nover the fireplace is a portrait of Lady Argenta.  She is holding a beautiful blood red ruby the size of an \napple.  Her smile betrays a hint of mischievousness. \n\nMonster: \n \nTreasure: The only thing of value in the room is the teacup.  It is a magical singing teacup.  When lifted \noff the saucer, the cup will begin to randomly sing one of the 100 songs it knows. \n Caster Level: 3rd; Prerequisites: Create Wondrous Items, Craft (ceramics), Perform skill (the cup will \nknow 20 songs per rank); Market Value: 75 gp. \n \n8.  Shelves line this room.  They are all empty now.  A broken bed warmer lays next to a small table and \nchair in the center of the room. \n\nMonster: \nTreasure: \n\n\n\nTrap: \n \n9.  This small room is lined with hangers and hooks.  A chest of drawers is against the east wall. \n\nThis was Lady Argenta’s closet.  It is now empty of clothes or other valuables. \n \nMonster: \n \n10. The walls of this lovely bathing room are painted with peaceful scenes of spring and summer.  The \nceiling and floor are mirrored and the floor retains some of its original polish.  An ornate marble and silver \nenameled oval bathtub is against the eastern wall.  A silver enameled towel rack standing next to the tub \nholds the remains of a thick towel and washcloth.  Many small and lovely soft soap containers are \nscattered randomly about the room.  Bath oil pearls litter the now empty tub.  At the head of the tub is a \ndelicately sculpted tray centered with a small vase.  It is decorated by three sets of three small gems.  \nEach set of three is a different color — red, blue, and yellow. \n\nAfter one round, an ubue will enter from room UL 11 to investigate the noise in the bathing room.  If there \nare more than 3 opponents, he will summon help from the remaining two ubues in room UL 11.  If the \nparty is too strong, the monsters will retreat into room UL 11. \n\nThe tray at the head of the tub is used to create water for bathing.  The magic works like this: Two red \nstones placed on the tray create hot water, two yellow stones bring cold, and two blue ones remove it.  \nMix a yellow and a red and the result is lukewarm water.  The blue ones only work with each other.  The \ntub will fill to capacity in 3 rounds.  It will empty in 1 round. \n \nUbue (3): CR 2; Large Humanoid; HD 3d8+6; hp 21, 19, 16; Init –1 (Dex); Spd 20 ft.; AC 17 (–1 size, –1 \nDex, +6 natural, +3 hide); Atk +5 melee (×3) (1d6+3, club or 1d4+3 slam); Face 10 ft. by 10 ft.; Reach 10 \nft.; SA Superior Three–Weapon Fighting; SQ Low–Light Vision 30 ft.; AL CN; SV Fort +2, Ref –1, Will –1; \nStr 16, Dex 9, Con 15, Int 8, Wis 9, Cha 12. \n\nSkills and Feats Climb +4, Hide +0, Listen +4, Search +4, Spot +5, Power Attack. \nSA—Superior Three–Weapon Fighting Because each of its three heads controls an arm, the ubue \n\ndoes not suffer an attack penalty for attacking with three weapons. \n \n11.  Three makeshift beds are lined against the south wall.  A table with three chairs, and a huge stew pot \nsit near the fireplace.  A tub filled with water and dishes is also near the fireplace.  The walls are covered \nin portraits and other scenic paintings.  Most of the portraits are of the Lady Argenta or of the Silver \nWarrior.  One is of the red dragon, but it has been slashed in several places. \n\nThis is the lair of three ubues.  They have collected all the paintings they could find to decorate the walls.  \nThe ubues are a family unit; one of the ubues is female, and one is slightly smaller than the others. \n\nThe only thing of value in this room is the small chest of 40 gp hidden under a loose brick in the \nfireplace. \n \n12. This small room has only one stool and a table shoved out of the way against the north wall.  There is \na wheel on the south wall. \n\nThis was a guard station.  The wheel is used to lift the portcullis in the hallway, which is presently \nlowered.  A Strength check (DC 19) will be needed to lift the portcullis if the wheel is not used.  Otherwise, \none character with normal strength will be able to lift it. \n \nMonster: \n \nTreasure: \n \nTrap: \n \n\n\n\n13.  This garden is overgrown with weeds.  The paths have disappeared into the underbrush, and the \nonly statue is now completely grown over with thick purplish vines.  Water can be heard, but not seen. \n\nTwo deadly plants now inhabit this plush garden, a Jupiter bloodsucker with 6 vines, one of which is \nwrapped around the statue, and 8 archer bushes.  The archer bushes will attack only if disturbed.  The \nJupiter blood sucker will move towards its intended victim, wrap itself around him or her and place one of \nits giant leaves over the victim’s face, thus smothering the victim while inserting its needle sharp thorns to \ndrain the victim’s blood. \n\nA fountain can be found by carefully searching near the southeast corner of the garden.  The fountain \nhas healing powers that will affect a character like a cure critical wounds spell as cast by a 10th level cleric \n(heals 4d8+10 hp of damage).  It will cure each person once.  Any attempts to use the water again will not \nbe successful, nor will the healing power of the water remain if taken out of the fountain.  The water must \nbe drunk or lapped up straight from the fountain. \n \nArcher Bush (8): CR 1; Hardness 4; hp 2; any creature within 10 ft., must make a Reflex save (DC 11) or \nbe struck by several of these small, sharp thorns, taking 1d4 points of damage and be at –1.  The \naffected character must make a Fortitude save (DC 11) or get an infection for a further –1 modifier.   \n \nJupiter Bloodsucker (1): CR 1; Medium–size Plant; HD 3d8+3; hp 21; Init –3 (Dex); Spd 5 ft.; AC 15 (–3 \nDex, +8 natural); Atk +3 melee (1d6+1 plus blood drain, slam); SA Improved Grab, Blood Drain, Hold, \nSmother; SQ Fire Vulnerability, Plant; AL N; SV Fort +5, Ref –2, Will +1; Str 12, Dex 5, Con 15, Int ––, \nWis 10, Cha 10. \n\nSA––Improved Grab If a Jupiter bloodsucker hits with its slam attack, it latches on and immediately \nbegins to drain the victim’s blood.  It can use its Hold attack the next round; Blood Drain A Jupiter \nbloodsucker drains 1 point of temporary Constitution per round from its victim per leaf attached.  If \nreduced to 0 Constitution, the victim dies; Hold Each round it maintains contact a Jupiter bloodsucker can \nattach one more vine to its opponent.  Any held opponent must make a Strength or Escape Artist check \n(DC 12 +1 per vine) in order to free itself from the plant; Smother At least one of the leaves of a Jupiter \nbloodsucker goes over the mouth and nose of its victim, causing suffocation (see the rules for suffocation \non page 88 of the DMG.) \n\nSQ––Fire Vulnerability Jupiter bloodsuckers take double damage from any fire attacks; Plant Immune \nto poison, sleep, stunning, paralysis, and polymorphing.  Not subject to critical hits or mind–influencing \nspells and effects. \n \n14.  Across from the double doors of this huge room stands a massive, hand carved wooden throne upon \na dais.  Two statues of warriors, one to either side of the throne, stand as silent guardians.  In the center \nof the room are two huge columns.  There are fireplaces on both the east and the west wall.  Tapestries \nhang on the north wall.  They record scenes of pomp and procession, royal galas and feasts once held in \ngreat halls.  In the southeast and southwest corners are two more statues, duplicates of the ones \nguarding the throne. \n\nIf the players linger here for more than one turn there is a 20% chance that 1d4+3 ubues will enter \nthrough the double doors and challenge the players’ right to be here.  If no ubues are indicated, check \nonce for wandering monsters.  If a wandering monster is indicated, use the Wandering Monster Table in \nthe front of the module.  If not, then no encounter will occur in this area. \n \nUbue (3): CR 2; Large Humanoid; HD 3d8+6; hp 16 each; Init –1 (Dex); Spd 20 ft.; AC 17 (–1 size, –1 \nDex, +6 natural, +3 hide); Atk +5 melee (×3) (1d6+3, club or 1d4+3 slam); Face 10 ft. by 10 ft.; Reach 10 \nft.; SA Superior Three–Weapon Fighting; SQ Low–Light Vision 30 ft.; AL CN; SV Fort +2, Ref –1, Will –1; \nStr 16, Dex 9, Con 15, Int 8, Wis 9, Cha 12. \n\nSkills and Feats Climb +4, Hide +0, Listen +4, Search +4, Spot +5, Power Attack. \nSA—Superior Three–Weapon Fighting Because each of its three heads controls an arm, the ubue \n\ndoes not suffer an attack penalty for attacking with three weapons. \n \n\n\n\n15.  This room contains several couches.  A small marble table and marble bench sit in front of the \nfireplace.  Thick layers of dust cover the furniture and floor. \n\nNo one has been in this room since the palace was deserted by Lady Argenta. \nDM Note: If the adventurers exploring this ruins have at least two swords +1 or a third level cleric, this \n\nroom as well as room UL 16 would be an ideal location for the undead. \n \n16. This bedchamber has an eerie appearance.  Dust and cobwebs cover everything so thickly that it is \nnearly impossible to distinguish exactly what furnishings are here. \n\nIn this room is a bed, a large chest filled with old nightshirts, a stool, and a wardrobe (empty).  If the \nplayers venture into this room their movement rate will be cut by ¼ due to the thickness of the dust and \ncobwebs.  If the players spend more than 2 turns in this room an image of an elf without feet or hands will \nappear floating above the bed and remain there until someone sees him (Spot check DC 15).  When he is \nnoticed, he will smile cruelly and then move towards the person who first saw him, waving his arms wildly.  \nHe will sweep down on the character, but not touch him or her.  This action will continue for three rounds \nafter which time the elf will disappear and all that will remain is laughter echoing off the walls.  When the \nlaughter stops, the door will slam shut and lock.  It will take a Strength check (DC 21) to open the door \nonce it has been shut. \n \n17.  A single pedestal with a glass case on top of it stands in the middle of this room.  A small brown box \nwith strange runes carved into it is inside the glass case. \n\nThis is the room that holds the ruby known as “My Lady’s Heart.”  As soon as the glass case is touched, \nLady Argenta will appear.  She is not an illusion.  She is a ghost and is here to protect the jewel. \n\nShe will manifest and plea to the characters to leave the gem in its place.  Note that the ghost of the \nPrincess is lawful good.  She is not an evil spirit, and is not here to cause mayhem.  She returned to this \nworld after death for the sole purpose of protecting the symbol of her peoples’ love for her: the jewel \ncalled “My Lady’s Heart.”  Characters of good alignment may realize that she  isn’t a threat to anyone not \nthere to steal the gem.  If the characters do manage to get into conversation with Argenta, this will quickly \nbecome apparent.  It is unlikely that the characters will be able to defeat her if they anger her or ignore \nher pleas to leave the jewel. \n \nThings the Princess Knows: \n1. Her focus on this plane is “My Lady’s Heart”; where it goes, she goes.  In other words, she will haunt \n\nwhoever holds the stone. \n2. The Silver Warrior charmed her and killed her after she refused to give him the jewel.  He was in turn \n\nkilled by her loyal followers and haunts this palace with her. \n3. She and the Silver Warrior have been battling for control of the Palace for centuries.  He is slowly \n\ngaining control, which is the reason for the evil creatures that have come to take up residence in the \npalace. \n\n4. The focus of the Silver Warrior on this plane is the precincts of the Palace itself; he cannot leave its \nwalls. \n\n5. In order for her to find peace, “My Lady’s Heart” must be taken to the Dwarves who dwell in the \nMoorfowl Mountains near the Misty Swamp.  The Silver Warrior won’t be able to leave the Palace to \npursue her, and the Dwarves will keep the gem well guarded. \n \nSoon after the characters enter the room, the ghost of the Silver Warrior will appear and attack.  \n\nArgenta will join in on the side of the characters as they do battle with the evil ghost. \n \nThe Ghost of Princess Argenta: CR 7; Medium–size Undead (Incorporeal); HD 5d12; hp 32; Init +2 \n(Dex); Spd 30 ft. fly (perfect); AC 16 (+2 Dex, +4 deflection) or 12 (+2 Dex); Atk +2 melee (1d4–1, \ndagger); SA Manifestation, Frightful Moan, Telekinesis; SQ Rejuvenation, Turn Resistance +4; AL LG; SV \nFort +1, Ref +3, Will +5; Str 7, Dex 14, Con ––, Int 16, Wis 12, Cha 18. \n\nSkills Appraise +9, Diplomacy +12, Handle Animal +11, Innuendo +7, Listen +9, Perform +11, Ride \n+6, Sense Motive +9, Spot +8. \n\n\n\nSA—Manifestation; Frightful Moan The ghost can moan as a standard action.

It is only 1” in diameter but is worth \n10,000 gp. \n\nDMs Note: It is unlikely that the characters will be able to sell this gem for its full value in any local \ncity; it is simply too expensive.  If the characters get out of the palace alive with the stone word will quickly \nreach the ears of Lady D’hmis.  She will dispatch her army to track them down and gain the stone for \nherself.  She may even dispatch assassins against them!  Lady D’hmis could prove to be a long–standing \nenemy of the characters. \n\nThe army of Gulluvia on the move is a terrifying sight in the local region, and if it is made known why \nthe army is marching, the characters will have no safe havens anywhere; everyone from the lowliest \npeasant to the greatest warrior will be trying to get the stone away from them and give it to the army to \nplacate Lady D’hmis.  Other unscrupulous persons may also try to get the stone from them.  Giving the \njewel to the Dwarves, as per Argenta’s request, is the only way for the characters to avoid some very \nunpleasant business.  Dwarven allies are far better for them than having Lady D’hmis as an enemy! \n \n18.  A large pallet lies against the western wall near several large cushions.  A chest and several smaller \nboxes line the north wall from comer to door.  There is a fire burning in the fireplace and a large pot of \nhorrible smelling food cooking in it. \n\nThis room is filled with 7 male ubues,.  The chief will ask why the party is invading their lair.  If the answer \nis unacceptable the ubues will fight to protect their females and children (in room 19).  They will retreat \ninto room 19 if necessary.  In this encounter only, the players will not have time to examine the room \nbefore combat begins.  The room description should be read after the ubues have been defeated. \n \nUbue (7): CR 2; Large Humanoid; HD 3d8+6; hp 21, 19, 18, 16, 13, 13, 11; Init –1 (Dex); Spd 20 ft.; AC \n17 (–1 size, –1 Dex, +6 natural, +3 hide); Atk +5 melee (×3) (1d6+3, club or 1d4+3 slam); Face 10 ft. by \n10 ft.; Reach 10 ft.; SA Superior Three–Weapon Fighting; SQ Low–Light Vision 30 ft.; AL CN; SV Fort +2, \nRef –1, Will –1; Str 16, Dex 9, Con 15, Int 8, Wis 9, Cha 12. \n\nSkills and Feats Climb +4, Hide +0, Listen +4, Search +4, Spot +5, Power Attack. \nSA—Superior Three–Weapon Fighting Because each of its three heads controls an arm, the ubue \n\ndoes not suffer an attack penalty for attacking with three weapons. \n \nTreasure: The only things of value in this area are 45 gp, a silver bracelet (3 gp), a pearl necklace (15 \ngp), and a music box with a dancing couple on top (150 gp).  These items are inside a small chest at the \nnorth end of the room. \n \n\n\n\n19.  This room is filled with ubues. \n\nThree female ubues and four ubue children are in this room.  The women are working and the children \nare playing. \n\nIf the players enter this area from the entrance level use this description: \nOne male ubue guard  will be standing on the east side of the door.  If the intruders outnumber him 4 \n\nto 1, he will retreat and sound the alarm.  Room UL 19 will be cleared of all females and children and only \nthe ubues from room UL 18 will join the guard and attack. \n\nIf the party enters from room UL 18 the females will retreat down the stairs, hoping to avoid a \nconfrontation and to save the children.  They will fight if attacked.  Once out the door, the females will \nplace a heavy iron bar against the door to keep the adventurers from following.  Characters will have to \nmake opposed Strength checks in order to prevent the females from securing the door.  It will take a \nStrength check (DC 20) to open the door once it has been secured.  However, by the time the door is \nopened, the females will already be down the stairs and gone.  They will bypass all rooms until they have \nreached the small worship area of room EL 15. \n\nIf the characters enter from the hallway the adventurers will find the females busily going about their \ntasks.  Once the characters have opened the door, and given the females a chance to see them, the \nubues will sound an alarm and then follow the actions outlined for escape. \n \nUbue (4): CR 2; Large Humanoid; HD 3d8+6; hp male guard 21, females 14, 13, 12; Init –1 (Dex); Spd 20 \nft.; AC 17 (–1 size, –1 Dex, +6 natural, +3 hide); Atk +5 melee (×3) (1d6+3, club or 1d4+3 slam); Face 10 \nft. by 10 ft.; Reach 10 ft.; SA Superior Three–Weapon Fighting; SQ Low–Light Vision 30 ft.; AL CN; SV \nFort +2, Ref –1, Will –1; Str 16, Dex 9, Con 15, Int 8, Wis 9, Cha 12. \n\nSkills and Feats Climb +4, Hide +0, Listen +4, Search +4, Spot +5, Power Attack. \nSA—Superior Three–Weapon Fighting Because each of its three heads controls an arm, the ubue \n\ndoes not suffer an attack penalty for attacking with three weapons. \nThe children do not fight, and have hp 6, 3, 4, 4. \n\n \nTreasure: A total of 13 cp, 4 silver bracelets (2 gp each) a silver neck–chain (1 sp) and three potions \n(healing) are in various places in the room. \n \n20.  This appears to be an empty room. \n\nMonster: \n \nTreasure: \n \nTrap: \n \n21.  Corridor \n\nAs the party steps under this archway, they step on a hidden pressure plate that rings an alarm bell in \nroom UL 22, warning the monster there of the party’s presence.  Search check (DC 20); Disable Device \n(DC 16). \n \n22. A beautiful young woman hangs from the ceiling.  Nine ugly men can be seen poking their swords \nlightly into her flesh, all the while taunting her in an unknown language and pulling at what few clothes \nshe has on.  Part of her ankle length hair has been wrapped around her legs, securely binding them \ntogether, while the rest of her hair has been used to tie her hands to a ceiling beam.  A long U shaped \ntable dominates most of the floor space.  A huge fireplace is on the north wall. \n\nThere is no woman being tortured by nine men.  It is an illusion produced by the monster living in this \nroom, a decapus.  It will attempt to lure unsuspecting adventurers into its reach so that it may attack \nthem.  (For exact details on the decapus, see the New Monster Section at the back of the module.) \n \nDecapus (1): CR 4; Large Aberration; HD 5d8+15; hp 33; Init –2 (Dex); Spd 5 ft.; AC 15 (–1 size, –2 Dex, \n+8 natural); Atk +6 melee (×9) (1d6+4, slam) or +6 melee (2d8+2, bite); Face 10 ft. by 10 ft.; Reach 10 ft.; \n\n\n\nSA Improved Grab, Constrict 1d6+4, Rend 2d6+6; SQ Illusion, Ventriloquism; AL CE; SV Fort +4, Ref –1, \nWill +4; Str 18, Dex 6, Con 17, Int 14, Wis 11, Cha 14. \n\nSkills and Feats Climb +18, Listen+10, Move Silently +4, Spot +8, Multiattack, Multidexterity. \nSA––Improved Grab If a decapus hits a Medium–size or smaller opponent with a tentacle attack it \n\ncan constrict.  If it hits a single opponent with all three tentacles it will rend; Constrict A decapus can \nconstrict any grappled opponent, automatically inflicting slam damage each round; Rend A decapus that \nhas hit with all three of its tentacle attacks on a single opponent will wrench and tear the flesh, inflicting \n2d6+6 points of damage. \n\nSQ––Illusions Will save (DC 14) if interacted with, can disguise itself as other creatures, or as part of \na wall, or anything else it feels will attract the victims to it; Ventriloquism Will save (DC 14) to detect as \nfalse. \n \nTreasure: One hundred silver pieces, a small pouch of rubies (13 rubies, 10–40 [1d4x10] gp each), and a \nsilver tipped arrow are hidden under a loose stone in the fireplace; Search check (DC 20) to find.. \n \n23. This appears to be an empty room. \n\nIt is recommended that no monster, treasure, or trap be placed here. \n \n24. A statue of a young girl playing with a dove is in the southeastern corner of this oddly shaped room.  \nA large hand carved bookcase stands next to the northeastern wall.  Two wooden benches, one in front \nof each of the two windows facing southwest, have scrolls lying upon them.  A dead potted tree sits in the \nnorthwest corner. \n\nHidden in the tree pot are three strange looking eggs.  They are shaped much like oranges and have a \nbright red crystal shell.  Any character touching one of the eggs may sustain damage if the shell is \nbroken.  The substance in the eggs can cause paralysis and a character breaking the eggs will suffer 1–4 \npoints of damage and must make a Fortitude save (DC 12) or be paralyzed for 2d6 rounds.  If removed \nfrom the nest, the eggs will not hatch.  It will be up to the DM to decide what laid the eggs. \n \nTreasure: The 13 scrolls are simply works of common reading.  However, the bands that hold them are \npure silver (3 gp each). \n \n25.  In this room is a massive canopy bed concealed behind thick dark red curtains, a long dresser with \nmatching chest of drawers, and a large, stuffed easy chair.  Three matching rugs lay side by side on the \nfloor. \n\nThis room is haunted by a poltergeist   As soon as the characters have entered, the curtains on the bed \nwill begin to move as if someone were occupying the bed.  Though nothing will be discovered there, a \nman–like form will appear to be in the bed under the covers.  After 3 rounds have passed, drawers will \nopen and close, and the rugs will move about on their own attempting to knock down adventurers who \nmay be standing on them.  The easy chair will dance across the floor, then rise up into the air and spin \nabout for a round before crashing back down on the floor where it originally stood.  The decorative balls \non the bedposts will unscrew themselves and then float effortlessly in the air.  They will drop on an \nunarmored character’s head (+3 ranged attack, 1d4 damage).  Finally, dust will collect into a pile and then \nbillow up into a whirlwind causing characters to cough uncontrollably for 1–4 rounds unless a they make a \nFortitude save (DC 15). \n\nThere is nothing of value in this room. \n \n26. This small barred alcove looks into a temple room.  There are two large cushioned chairs sitting here.  \nA small book lies on the floor between them. \n\nThe book was a prayer book, but is now just rotten leather and paper. \n \nTrap: \n \n27.  This empty temple room is uneasily quiet.  The dais on the west wall appears harmless, but seems to \n\n\n\nchange, in some way, each time it is looked at.  (The stairs seem to appear and disappear.  The holy \nsymbol seems to move about on the wall.)  Faint whistling can be heard from time to time.  It seems to \nalmost have a melody. \n\nMonster: \n \nTreasure: \n \nTrap: \n \n28.  This room is filled with holy symbols from many different religions.  A mace hangs on the walls \nbetween two windows that open onto the surrounding lands.  The windows face northwest. \n\nAfter one round, a secret door will open on the east wall.  Catharandamus, a cleric, will step out and \nchallenge the players.  He will want to know why they are in his domain. \n\nIf Catharandamus is satisfied with the party’s answers, he will appear to be friendly.  He may ask for \nan offering.  He may also sell the party one bottle of Anterian brandy (see Magic Items, p 31), as this \nwould appeal to his sense of humor.  He might even ask the party to join him!  (If the party agrees, they \nbecome his retainers and the DM can develop the campaign from there––the party may even end up \ndefending the palace from NPC parties!) \n\nIf he is not satisfied with their answers he’ll announce that he will attack if they do not leave now.  \nWhen he announces that he will attack, two dwarves and a female werebear will step out from the secret \ndoor to join him.  The dwarves, Xyzom and Boron will move out first, letting Aleigha follow who will be in \nhuman form.  They will attempt to capture their opponents in order to question them.   \n \nCatharandamus male human Clr3 (of Nerull, Death and Evil domains): CR 3; Medium–size \nHumanoid (Human); HD 3d8+3; hp 18; Init +6 (Dex, Improved Initiative); Spd 20 ft.; AC 17 (+2 Dex, +5 \nchainmail); Atk +3 melee (2d4, scythe); SQ Spells, Rebuke Undead (×4); AL CE; SV Fort +4, Ref +2, Will \n+6; Str 11, Dex 14, Con 13, Int 14, Wis 16, Cha 12. \n\nSkills and Feats Concentration +7, Diplomacy +7, Heal +6, Knowledge (religion) +8, Spellcraft +8, \nExtra Rebuking, Improved Initiative, Scribe Scroll. \n\nSpells 0 4; 1st 3; 2nd 2. \nDomain Spells 1st cause fear; 2nd death knell. \nPossessions  Chainmail, scythe, robes, unholy symbol of Nerull. \n\n \nXyzom, male dwarf War3: CR 3; Medium–size Humanoid (Dwarf); HD 3d8+9; hp 25; Init +0 (Dex); Spd \n20 ft.; AC 18 (+8 plate mail); Atk +6 melee (1d8+3, longsword); AL CE; SV Fort +6, Ref +1, Will +0; Str \n16, Dex 11, Con 17, Int 10, Wis 8, Cha 7. \n\nPossessions  Xysom wears plate mail sized for a dwarf and carries a longsword. \n \nBoron, male dwarf War3: CR 3; Medium–size Humanoid (Dwarf); HD 3d8+6; hp 19; Init +2 (Dex); Spd \n20 ft.; AC 17 (+2 Dex, +5 chain mail); Atk +6 melee (1d8+3, warhammer); AL CE; SV Fort +5, Ref +3, Will \n+0; Str 16, Dex 14, Con 15, Int 8, Wis 8, Cha 6. \n\nPossessions  Boron wears chain mail sized for a dwarf, and carries a warhammer. \n \nAleigha (human form), female War3: CR 3; Medium–size Shapechanger (Werebear); HD 3d8+6; hp 21; \nInit +1(Dex); Spd 20 ft.; AC 16 (+1 Dex, +5 chain mail); Atk +7 melee (1d8+4, longsword +2); SA \nLycanthropic Empathy, Curse of Lycanthropy; SQ Alternate Form, Damage Reduction 15/silver; AL CG; \nSV Fort +5, Ref +2, Will +0; Str 14, Dex 13, Con 15, Int 14, Wis 8, Cha 11. \n\nSkills and Feats Animal Empathy +2 (+6 vs. bears), Climb +4, Handle Animal +5, Intimidate +2, Jump \n+4, Ride +4. \n\nSA—Lycanthropic Empathy Has empathy and can communicate basic concepts to bears, and gives a \n+4 racial bonus to attempts to influence them; Curse of Lycanthropy Any humanoid bitten by a werebear \nin animal form must make a Fortitude save (DC 15) or contract lycanthropy (werebear). \n\nSQ—Alternate Form Can assume bear form as a standard action, but her gear does not change with \nher (it simply drops away).

It consists of 400 gp, 1000 sp, a pouch \nof fire agates (5 gp each), a potion of detect thoughts, and 15 bottles of Anterian brandy (250 gp each). \n \n29. This large ballroom appears to have at one time been decorated in silver, red, and blue.  Two huge \nfireplaces, one on the west and the other on the east wall, hold the petrified remains of beasts that were \nonce cooked in them; a couple of pigs, a deer and a side of beef. A huge ornate brass bell hangs down \nfrom the ceiling and is supported by 4 columns of white marble.  Whistling sounds can be heard.  They \nhave a very pleasant melody. \n\nThe whistle is coming from a giant marble snake hiding in the wire bell.  Its whistle has an effect much like \na charm spell, and everyone who hears it must make a save or be charmed by the snake.  (For details on \nthe charming see New Monster section in the back of the module.) \n \nMarble Snake (1): CR 3; Large Beast; HD 3d10+9; hp 34; Init +1 (Dex); Spd 50 ft.; AC 12 (–1 size, +1 \nDex, +2 natural); Atk +6 melee (1d6+6, bite); Face 5 ft. by 20 ft.; SA Whistle ; AL N; SV Fort +6, Ref +1, \nWill +0; Str 18, Dex 13, Con 16, Int 3, Wis 10, Cha 11. \n\nSkills Hide +4, Move Silently +4, Spot +2. \nSA—Whistle Range 50 ft., Will save (DC 12) or become entranced and be drawn to the snake.

This balcony is blocked by vines and thorn bushes. \n\nIf the players decide to enter the balcony, they will be attacked by a Jupiter bloodsucker lurking there.  It \nhas 13 vines wrapped about the balcony. \n \nJupiter Bloodsucker (1): CR 1; Medium–size Plant; HD 3d8+3; hp 15; Init –3 (Dex); Spd 5 ft.; AC 15 (–3 \nDex, +8 natural); Atk +3 melee (1d6+1 plus blood drain, slam); SA Improved Grab, Blood Drain, Hold, \nSmother; SQ Fire Vulnerability, Plant; AL N; SV Fort +5, Ref –2, Will +1; Str 12, Dex 5, Con 15, Int ––, \nWis 10, Cha 10. \n\nSA––Improved Grab If a Jupiter bloodsucker hits with its slam attack, it latches on and immediately \nbegins to drain the victim’s blood.

A chess set, with a game apparently in \nprogress (or never finished), sits upon it.  A large map of a world unknown to the adventurers has been \npainted on the floor.  Little metal figures are placed on several of the countries.  There is a window on the \nwest wall.  A fireplace on the south wall has fresh logs in it. \n\nThis room is a game and recreation room for Catharandamus and his friends.  Catharandamus and his \nfriends inhabited this room also.  They were all fond of playing games.  A meerschaum carved bowl pipe \nand an empty goblet lie on one side of the table; an empty wine glass and a peacock fan lie on the other \nside of the table. \n \nTreasure: The chess pieces are gold and silver–plated (2000 gp).  The pipe is elegantly carved and has \nsilver fittings (30 gp).  There is a bottle of Anterian brandy (250 gp) sitting on the mantle of the fireplace \n \nMonster: \n \nTrap: \n \n\nPART 5: KEY TO THE GUARD TOWER LEVEL \nThis entire level is guarded by the Protectors.  No room will have a monster, treasure, or trap placed in it.  \nThe rooms are numbered and a brief description of each is given.  The DM may at a later time decide to \nremove the Protectors and place monsters, treasure, and traps in this area.  This area is to be considered \na resting place, a haven for lawful characters.  No chaotic or neutral character may enter here without \nbeing challenged by a Protector.  Lawful characters will be allowed to come and go freely, and many \nnever know that the Protectors are here.  (For more information on the Protectors, see the New Monster \nsection in the back of the module.) \n \n1. This is the top of the stairwell.  A weapons rack is against the south wall.  It holds two swords, a \n\nmace, and a dagger, all in fairly good condition. \n2. This room resembles an enclosed walkway.  Three windows line the west wall.  In the center of the \n\nroom are two massive square columns.  Four weapons racks are in this area, but all are empty. \n3. This strangely shaped room is divided into two sections, one facing south and the other west.  Each \n\nsection has one empty weapons rack and two windows.  A large gong can be seen from two of the \nwindows in an alcove. \n\n4. This room is sectioned off into two chambers.  An empty weapons rack hangs against the north wall \nand the west wall.  There are five windows on the southeastern wall. \n\n5. This large room has two empty weapons racks, a long one and a short one, and 4 windows on the \neast wall. \n\n6. This room has a large square column in the center, and two empty weapon racks, one on the east \nwall, the other on the south wall.  There are 5 windows on the northwest wall. \n\n7. This is the gong that can be seen from room TL 3.  If the players hit the gong, the sound can be \nheard for miles.  It may also alert any wandering monster in the surrounding lands, thus causing a \nproblem when the adventurers decide to head back to the city.  The battlement encompasses the \nentire guard tower.  All the windows have a glass–like substance secured over them to keep out cold, \nwind, and rain.  The walkway around the battlements is clear. \n\n \nCREDITS \nDesign: Jean Wells. \nDevelopment: Brian Pitzer, Jean Wells. \nEditing and Production: Edward G. Sollers, Stephen D.

They grow wild, quickly killing almost \neverything else that grows near them.  The only plant capable of sustaining its life among archer bushes \nis the jupiter blood sucker and it is commonly found with them. \n\nSome peasants or men of the woods occasionally hide treasures in the midst of many archer bushes.  \nThey simply shield themselves from the thorns by hiding behind a large makeshift shield, piece of wood \nor a clump or rocks, casting a handful of rocks at the bushes, entering the growth, hiding their valuables \nand then leaving the bushes before they have time to grow new thorns.  Sometimes these bushes are \nused to hide openings in caves or other types of entranceways. \n\nArcher bushes defend themselves by shooting small thorns at whatever disturbs them. \nArcher bushes have a hardness of 2 and 4 hit points. \nThorns (Ex): The thorns of an archer bush grow along the branches of the plant and number in the \n\nthousands.  The bush releases only the thorns on a branch that is disturbed.  Any creature within 10 feet \nof a disturbed archer bush must make a Reflex save (DC 11) or be struck by several of these small, sharp \nthorns, taking 1d4 points of damage (10 thorns hit per point of damage taken).  Any creature struck by the \nthorns will have a –1 conditional modifier until they are removed. \n\nThe small thorns work their way into the skin within one day, causing swelling and infections 1n 1d3 \ndays unless the affected character makes a Fortitude save (DC 11).  An infected character suffers a \nfurther –1 conditional modifier on all rolls for 1d6 days, at which time their body fights off the infection.  A \ncure light wounds will cure the swelling and infections, but the thorns must be picked out by hand. \n\nThorn growth takes only 1 turn. \n \nBARIC \nSmall Beast \nHit Dice: 2d10 (11 hp) \nInitiative: +1 (Dex) \nSpeed: 40 ft. \nAC: 13 (+1 size, +1 Dex, +1 natural) \nAttacks: 2 claws +2 melee or bite +2 melee \nDamage: Claw 1d3+1 or bite 1d8 \nFace/Reach: 5 ft. by 5 ft./5 ft. \nSpecial Qualities:  Scent \nSaves: Fort +3, Ref +4, Will +0 \nAbilities: Str 12, Dex 13, Con 11, Int 4, Wis 10, Cha 10 \nSkills: Listen +3, Spot +3, Wilderness Lore +3 \n\nClimate/Terrain: Any land and underground \nOrganization: Solitary or pack (1–8) \nChallenge Rating: 1 \nTreasure: None \nAlignment: Always neutral \nAdvancement: 3–5 HD (Small); 6 HD (Medium-size) \n \nThis rat-like creature has 6 legs, black fur, and eyes that glow white just before it attacks.  Instead of a \nnormal rat-like face, the baric has a duck–like bill.  The bill is filled with many rows of small, needle sharp \nteeth.  This tough scavenger has been known to defeat a small pack of wild dogs by itself, and is \nconsidered an excellent hunter. \n\nBarics are approximately 3 feet long and weigh about 40 to 50 pounds.  Some males have been \nknown to reach a length of 7 feet and weigh nearly 150 pounds. \n\nBarics do not form family units, but they can be seen in packs run-ning wild in woods not frequented \nby humans or humankind.  The strongest baric is the leader of the pack, and their social system \n\n\n\nresembles that of wild wolves.  Females usually give birth to between 2 and 5 pups two or three times a \nyear.  Twenty percent of these do not live to adulthood as the males tend to eat them when the females \nare not around to protect the young. \n\nBarics are sometimes used for hunting or for pursuing escaped prisoners or slaves.  However, due to \ntheir unpredictable nature, training and handling a baric is very dangerous.  Many have turned on their \ntrainers and killed them before they could be saved. \n \nCombat \nBarics attack with a vicious combination of its sharp claws and teeth. \n \nBUBBLE \nMedium–Size Aberration \nHit Dice: 1/2d8 (2 hp) \nInitiative: +1 (Dex) \nSpeed: Swim 30 ft, fly 10 ft (poor) \nAC: 11 (+1 Dex) \nAttacks: Touch +1 melee \nDamage: Touch 1d4+paralysis \nFace/Reach: 5 ft. by 5 ft./5 ft. \nSpecial Attacks: Paralysis, engulf \nSpecial Qualities:  Immunities, reform \nSaves: Fort +0, Ref +1, Will +2 \nAbilities: Str –, Dex 13, Con 10, Int –, Wis 10, Cha 8 \nFeats: Weapon Finesse (touch) \n\nClimate/Terrain: Any aquatic \nOrganization: Swarm (3–18) \nChallenge Rating: 1/4 \nTreasure: Standard \nAlignment: Always neutral \nAdvancement: 1 HD (Medium–size) \n \nBubbles are giant air pockets that have been given life and intelligence by unknown means.  These \nstrange creatures dwell in lakes, ponds, and other large bodies of water. \n\nBubbles only form when there is a disturbance in their water, at which time small air pockets form out \nof the oxygen in the water.  These smaller air pockets jostle each other, joining and progressively forming \nlarger and larger ones until a full–size bubble is created and floats to the surface.  Once a disturbance \nstarts 3d6 bubbles will begin to form taking 2d4 rounds to do so. \n\nOnce formed, these creatures can fly short distances to reach opponents on shore. \n \nCombat \nA bubble’s only means of attack is to float to the surface of the body of water in which it resides, and \ntouching any creature near the water.  The outer surface of the bubble has a slight acidic quality to it. \n\nParalysis (Su): The touch of a bubble causes any opponent touched to make a Fortitude save (DC \n10) or be paralyzed for 1 hour. \n\nEngulf (Su): If a bubble successfully hits and paralyzes its opponent the bubble will engulf that \nopponent if the victim is Medium–sized or smaller and falls into the water (30% chance of this happening).  \nAn engulfed victim will begin to suffocate (see the rules for drowning on page 85 of the DMG) unless \nsomeone kills the bubble, thus releasing the victim.  This must be done before the bubble sinks back into \nthe depths of the water from which it came.  Once the victim is dead the bubble will expel the body, rise to \nthe surface and attack again.  The body, unless armored, will float to the surface. \n Immunities (Ex): A bubble is immune to damage from any bludgeoning or crushing attack.  Their \nbody simply deforms around the weapon and takes no damage.  Although they have a rudimentary \nintelligence, they have no real brain and are thus immune to all mind–influencing spells and effects. \n\n\n\nReform (Ex): A bubble, once destroyed, will reform into 2 more bubbles in 6 hours, unless the water \nit inhabits is drained onto an open flat area and then dried or absorbed into something such as cloth, \nearth, etc. \n\nFeats: Bubbles receive the Weapon Finesse (touch) feat for free. \n \nDECAPUS \nLarge Aberration \nHit Dice: 5d8+15 (37 hp) \nInitiative: –2 (Dex) \nSpeed: 5 ft \nAC: 15 (–1 size, –2 Dex, +8 natural) \nAttacks: 9 slams +6 melee or bite +6 melee \nDamage: Slam 1d6+4, bite 2d8+2 \nFace/Reach: 10 ft by 10 ft/0 ft (10 ft with tentacle) \nSpecial Attacks: Improved grab, constrict 1d6+4, rend 2d6+6 \nSpecial Qualities:  Illusion, ventriloquism \nSaves: Fort +4, Ref –1, Will +4 \nAbilities: Str 18, Dex 6, Con 17, Int 14, Wis 11, Cha 14 \nSkills: Climb +18, Listen+10, Move Silently +4, Spot +8 \nFeats: Multiattack, Multidexterity \n \n\nClimate/Terrain: Any underground \nOrganization: Solitary \nChallenge Rating: 4 \nTreasure: Standard \nAlignment: Always chaotic evil \nAdvancement: 6–10HD (Large), 11–15HD (Huge) \n \nThis clever monster has the innate ability to use both ventriloquism and illusions to lure victims into its \nden.  In its true form it has ten long tentacles extending from various parts of its body.  These tentacles \nhave many 3–inch diameter suction cups that it uses to grab its victims as well as to climb walls and \nceilings. \n\nThe most common color of a decapus is green, although some purple or yellow ones may be found.  \nA decapus has patches of hair growing about its body.  The hair is usually brown, but sometimes it is \nblack.  They have no iris in their eyes, only dark pupils.  The mouth of a decapus is a horrible thing to \nbehold.  It is very wide and has long yellow teeth and a terribly foul breath.  The decapus is incapable of \nhuman speech, but is an expert at mimicking a high–pitched scream.  It can also make guttural noises, \nwhich are under stood by others of its kind.  The sounds are extremely unpleasant for humans to hear.  \nThe only sound that can be understood in a decapus’ language other than a scream is the hideous \nlaughter it emits when it has killed its victim. \n \nCombat \nA decapus only uses 9 of its tentacles to fight with and can use no more than 3 on a single opponent.  \nThe tenth tentacle is used to suspend itself from the ceiling.  On the floor the decapus is practically \nhelpless, only being able to move short distances in a slow and uncoordinated fashion. \n Illusions (Su): At will, a decapus can make use of the 2nd level arcane spell minor image as cast by a \n5th level sorcerer (Will save DC 14).  It can disguise itself as other creatures, or as part of a wall, or \nanything else it feels will attract the victims to it.  Some decapus’ choose to appear as a helpless, \nbeautiful woman, usually hanging from the ceiling and being taunted by nine ugly men. \n Ventriloquism (Ex): A decapus is an expert at mimicking sounds, although it is incapable of duplicating \nactual conversation.  Any creature hearing sounds generated by a decapus must make a Will save (DC \n14) to detect the ruse.  Decapus’ understand that simple words and phrases such as “help me” and \n“come here” tend to attract bigger and better prey. \n Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, the decapus must hit an opponent of up to Medium-size with a \ntentacle attack. If it gets a hold, it can constrict. \n\n\n\n Constrict (Ex): A decapus can constrict any grappled opponent, automatically dealing slam damage \neach round. \n Rend (Ex): A decapus that hits a single opponent with three of its tentacle attacks tear the flesh, \ndealing 2d6+6 points of damage. \n Skills: A decapus receives a +4 racial bonus to Listen checks, and a +8 racial bonus to Climb checks. \n \nDecapus Society \n\nDecapuses usually live alone, preferring to hunt by themselves.  The only time they gather is during \nthe mating season.  At this time many of them can be seen hanging from ceilings, all making strange ugly \nsounds.  A female decapus will give birth to only one offspring, and if she is hungry or confused she may \neat it.  If she does not she will leave it alone, and it then claims its own territory.  Decapus young do not \nneed the care of their mothers, as do the young of some animals. \n\nThe Decapuses’ favorite food is human beings, but they enjoy elves and halflings too.  They will not \neat dwarves unless forced by starvation to do so.  Other creatures commonly eaten by a decapus are \nkobolds, orcs and ogres.  A delicacy to a decapus is mule meat.  They love it, and have been known to \nfollow the scent of a mule for weeks until they catch it, or grow weary of the chase. \n \nDIGER \nLarge Ooze \nHit Dice: 2d10+19 (30 hp) \nInitiative: –3 (Dex) \nSpeed: 5 ft., 30 ft. fly (poor), 40 ft. swim \nAC: 11 (–1 size, –3 Dex, +5 natural) \nAttacks: Touch +6 melee \nDamage: Touch 0 and paralysis \nFace/Reach: 15 ft. by 15 ft./5 ft. \nSpecial Attacks: Paralysis \nSpecial Qualities:  Limited flight, ooze \nSaves: Fort +2, Ref –2, Will –5 \nAbilities: Str 21, Dex 4, Con 15, Int ––, Wis 1, Cha 1 \n\nClimate/Terrain: Any underground \nOrganization: Solitary \nChallenge Rating: 2 \nTreasure: None \nAlignment: Always neutral \nAdvancement: 3–6HD (Large) \n \nThis unique creature can only be found in remote abandoned ruins where it seeks stone areas in order to \ndisguise itself as a marble pool.  It is capable of flying short distances by expanding its rubbery body with \nnatural helium.  It expels the helium in short puffs from one of four openings on its body.  These openings \naid the diger in movement.  When swimming the diger simply expels the helium as with flying, but glides \nfarther and faster.  Digers have a single faceted eye that resembles a gemstone or jewel. \n\nIts favorite mode of travel is to enter a large river or stream, glide out to a strong current, and float \nalong the surface.  When moving in this fashion, the diger need not rest except to sleep. \n \nCombat \nThe diger has no method of attack except to paralyze whatever may happen to come in contact with the \nparalyzing liquid it secretes as part of its camouflage. \n Paralysis (Ex): Any creature touched by a diger must make a Fortitude save (DC 13) or be paralyzed \nfor 1d6 rounds. \n\nA creature slain by the diger will be dissolved (including all items worn) and digested in 8 hours. \nLimited Flight (Ex): The diger is able to fly for a number of rounds equal to 1 plus half its \n\nConstitution score before it must land and rest.  It must rest a number of rounds equal three times the \nnumber of rounds it flew. \n\nOoze:  Immune to all mind–influencing spells and effects. \n\n\n\n \nMARMOSET, GIANT \nMedium–Size Animal \nHit Dice: 3d8+3 (13 hp) \nInitiative: +2 (Dex) \nSpeed: 40 ft, climb 30 ft \nAC: 15 (+2 Dex, +3 natural) \nAttacks: 2 claws +2 melee; or bite +2 melee; or tail +2 melee \nDamage: Claw 1d6; or bite 1d8; or tail 1d4 \nFace/Reach: 5 ft. by 5 ft./5 ft. \nSaves: Fort +1, Ref +2, Will +0 \nAbilities: Str 11, Dex 15, Con 13, Int 3, Wis 11, Cha 11 \nSkills: Climb +11, Hide +5, Listen +3, Move Silently +5, Spot +3 \nClimate/Terrain: Warm forest \nOrganization: Pack (2–8) \nChallenge Rating: 1 \nTreasure: Standard \nAlignment: Always neutral \nAdvancement: 4–9HD (Medium–size) \n \nThese ferocious monkeys roam the jungles freely and unopposed, for they are fierce and cunning \nfighters.   \n\nThey travel in large family groups; the males outnumber the females and every female will have at \nleast 1 young with her.  If a young marmoset monkey can be caught and trained, it will make an excellent \nguard.  Some monkeys grow large enough for a halfling to comfortably ride, and some halflings living in \njungles have been seen riding them into battle. \n \nCombat \nThough their natural weapons cause a great deal of damage, they often prefer to throw large stones from \nthe side of a cliff down onto their prey.  If fighting on the ground, they will also use their furry tail spike in \nbattle, but if in the trees, they will hang from their tails and use their bite and claws instead. \n *Skills: Giant marmosets receive a +8 racial bonus to climb. \n \nJUPITER BLOODSUCKER \nMedium–size Plant \nHit Dice: 3d8+6 (19 hp) \nInitiative: –3 (Dex) \nSpeed: 5 ft \nAC: 15 (–3 Dex, +8 natural) \nAttacks: Slam +3 melee \nDamage: Slam 1d6+1 plus blood drain \nFace/Reach: 5 ft. by 5 ft./5 ft. \nSpecial Attacks: Improved grab, blood drain, smother \nSpecial Qualities:  Fire vulnerability, plant, blindsight \nSaves: Fort +5, Ref –2, Will +1 \nAbilities: Str 12, Dex 5, Con 15, Int ––, Wis 10, Cha 10 \n\nClimate/Terrain: Any land \nOrganization: Bed (1–10) \nChallenge Rating: 3 \nTreasure: None \nAlignment: Always neutral \nAdvancement: 4–6HD (Medium–size); 7–9HD (Large) \n \nThis horrible plant is sometimes referred to as a vampire plant.  It has small hollow thorns on the \nunderside of its giant leaves that it uses to drain unwary victims of their blood.  The blood–sensing leaves \n\n\n\nwill move towards their prey silently and stealthily, sometimes to the point of uprooting the plant.  The \nleaves of this plant are dark green with red veins, the stems are transparent, and the blood drained from a \nfeeding can be seen flowing down the stem. \n\nThe Jupiter blood sucker fears fire, and will move away from it if possible.  The only way to \npermanently destroy this horrid plant is to bum it completely to the ground and then pull or dig up the \nroots and burn them also. \n \nCombat \nA jupiter bloodsucker prefers to place one leaf over a victim’s face smothering it to death while consuming \nits blood. The jupiter bloodsucker uses 1d3 other leaves to encircle a victim and hold it in place. \n Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, the jupiter bloodsucker must hit an opponent of up to Medium-\nsize with its slam attack. If it gets a hold, it wraps its opponent in its leaves and drains blood. \n After a successful grab, the jupiter bloodsucker can try to attach its remaining leaves with a single \ngrapple check. The opponent can escape with a single Escape Artist check, but the jupiter bloodsucker \ngets a +2 circumstance bonus for every leaf that was attached at the beginning of the opponent’s turn. \n Blood Drain (Ex): A jupiter bloodsucker deals 1 point of temporary Constitution per round per leaf \nattached. If reduced to Constitution 0, the victim has been completely drained of blood and dies. \n A creature that escapes heals Constitution damage at the rate of 1 point per hour. \n Smother (Ex):  A jupiter bloodsucker can, on a successful grapple check, cover the mouth and nose of \nits opponent. This deals suffocation damage (see the rules for suffocation on page 88 of the DMG). \n Fire Vulnerability (Ex): Jupiter bloodsuckers take double damage from fire attacks. \n Plant: Immune to poison, sleep, stunning, paralysis, and polymorphing.  Not subject to critical hits or \nmind–influencing spells and effects. \n \nMARBLE SNAKE \nLarge Beast \nHit Dice: 3d10+9 (25 hp) \nInitiative: +1 (Dex) \nSpeed: 20 ft \nAC: 12 (–1 size, +1 Dex, +2 natural) \nAttacks: Bite +6 melee \nDamage: Bite 1d6+6 \nFace/Reach: 5 ft by 5 ft (coiled)/10 ft \nSpecial Attacks: Whistle \nSaves: Fort +6, Ref +1, Will +0 \nAbilities: Str 18, Dex 13, Con 16, Int 3, Wis 10, Cha 11 \nSkills: Hide +4, Move Silently +4, Spot +2 \n\nClimate/Terrain: Any land \nOrganization: Pack (1–4) \nChallenge Rating: 2 \nTreasure: Standard \nAlignment: Always neutral \nAdvancement: 4–6HD (Large), 7–9HD (Huge) \n \nThis giant milk–white snake has gold facial hair around his head much like a lion’s mane.  Two very long \nfangs are set in a large mouth.  Its eyes are multi-faceted, and in bright light, colors seem to swirl in tiny \npools of each facet.  Its skin is transparent in some places, allowing thin blood veins to show through, \nthus the name marble snake. \n\nThis reptile prefers high, sunny altitudes, and will search for weeks for a place to make its nest.  Often \nit will elect to live in a ruined fortress or similar structures, burrowing through loose stones and dirt to \nmake a tunnel.  When not in its nest, or having laid it eggs (marble snakes lay 1–10 eggs) it will seek \nhigher ground or ledges so that it can observe without being observed. \n\nIf two or more snakes are found together, they are probably a family unit.  This family unit is often \nonly temporary, as the female snake will search for a place to lay her eggs in solitude.  The female will \n\n\n\noften leave the eggs after they hatch, though when some females find a suitable place to make their lair \nand they may decide to stay, but this is rare. \n \nCombat \nMarble snakes are lazy creatures, preferring to have their dinner come to them instead of hunting for \nthemselves.  They have a special whistling sound that can charm an intended victim. \n\nWhistle (Ex): Any creature within 50 feet of a marble snake must make a Will save (DC 12) or \nbecome entranced  for 1d4 rounds (treat as charm person).  The whistling sounds will draw the victim to a \nsnake, which will kill it after toying with it for a while.  Once it has actually struck its intended victim, the \nvictim is no longer under the snake’s influence and may then attack the snake.  The snake’s bite is not \npoisonous. \n \nPROTECTOR \nMedium–size Outsider \nHit Dice: 7d8+14 (45 hp) \nInitiative: +2 (Dex) \nSpeed: 50 ft. \nAC: 18 (+2 Dex, +6 natural) \nAttacks: Longsword +9/+4 melee \nDamage: Longsword 1d8+2 \nFace/Reach: 5 ft. by 5 ft./5 ft. \nSpecial Attacks: Airwalking, spells \nSpecial Qualities:  Telepathy, know alignment \nSaves: Fort +7, Ref +7, Will +12 \nAbilities: Str 15, Dex 15, Con 15, Int 20, Wis 20, Cha 20 \nSkills: Concentration +15, Diplomacy +15, Heal +11, Knowledge (the planes) +15, Innuendo +15, Listen \n+15, Scry +15, Sense Motive +15, Spellcraft +15, Spot +15 \nFeats: Expertise, Iron Will \n \n\nClimate/Terrain: Any land and underground \nOrganization: Solitary or group (1–10) \nChallenge Rating: 4 \nTreasure: Standard \nAlignment: Always lawful neutral \nAdvancement: 8–21HD (Large) \n \nThese translucent green beings are a gentle folk, protecting all lawful creatures that may enter the place \nthey are guarding.  They wear long flowing robes that appear to move in the breeze even though there \nmay be no air movements at all.  Most protectors are bald men, though some may appear as women with \nlong flowing hair. \n\nTheir bodies are slender, giving them the appearance of being much taller than they are, and they \nfloat 6 to 10 inches above the ground. \nThey do not speak aloud, as their race is capable of telepathy, and they know instantly the alignment of \nthe being or creature entering their protected area. \n\nAs superior beings, they overlook the mistakes of other lawful beings and try to help them gain a \nbetter understanding of how to live properly.  To them this means protecting lawful things and eliminating \nthe chaotic things to make a better world. \n \nCombat \nAnything or anyone who is not lawful (except for normal animals) will be immediately attacked.  They will \nnever attack a lawful creature even if it is attacking them; in this situation they try to make the best use of \ntheir Expertise feat.  The protectors know that lawful beings would not attack them if they understood the \nprotectors’ purpose. \n\nKnow Alignment (Su): Protectors automatically know the alignment of any creature that comes \nwithin 50 feet of it. \n\n\n\nAirwalking (Su): Protectors can constantly make use of the airwalking spell as if cast by a cleric with \na level equal to their hit dice.  This ability may be negated, but the protector can activate it again the next \nround as a free action. \n\nTelepathy (Su): Protectors communicate telepathically on a very basic level.  They can freely \ncommunicate with any intelligent creature within 50 feet regardless of languages known. \n\nSpells: All protectors can cast divine spells as a cleric with a level equal to their hit dice.  They must \nchoose Law as one of their domains, and may choose from either Knowledge or Protection for their other \ndomain.  The Save DC to resist a spell cast by a protector (when applicable) is 15 + the spell level. \n \nPURPLE MOSS \nCR 2 \nThis plant is a distant cousin of yellow mold.  It feeds on moisture, so any area in which it grows will be \nextremely dry. \n\nIt emits a heavy sweet smell that has the same effect as a sleep spell (Fortitude save DC 11).  Once \nthe victim has fallen asleep, the moss will quickly cover a Medium–size body in 4 rounds.  If the victim is \nsmaller than Medium–size, subtract 1 round per size category difference.  Larger victims add 2 rounds to \nthe time needed to cover per size category difference.  Purple moss can detect the warmth and moisture \nof breath, and it will begin growing over the victim’s mouth and nose first so that it will suffocate its victim \n(see the rules for suffocation on page 88 of the DMG).  Once this has been done, and the victim is dead, \nit will devour all soft material on the body (organs, skin, clothes, etc.) in less than 1 hour. \n\nA 5 ft. × 5f t. section of purple moss has 5 hp, and it cannot be destroyed except by normal or magical \nfire, or by any spell or poison that affects plant life.  Magical fire inflicts damage as per the spell or item \nthat produced the fire.  Torches inflict 1d4 points of damage at the first touch.  Any type of fire has a 75% \nchance of igniting the moss.  It burns quickly due to its dryness, so once alight the purple moss will take 2 \nhp of damage per round until it is all gone. \n \nUBUE \nLarge Humanoid \nHit Dice: 3d8+6 (19 hp) \nInitiative: –1 (Dex) \nSpeed: 20 ft. \nAC: 17 (–1 size, –1 Dex, +6 natural, +3 hide) \nAttacks: 3 clubs +5 melee or 3 slams +5 melee \nDamage: Club 1d6+3 or slam 1d4+3 \nFace/Reach: 5 ft. by 5 ft./10 ft. \nSpecial Attacks: Superior three–weapon fighting \nSpecial Qualities:  Low–light vision \nSaves: Fort +2, Ref –1, Will –1 \nAbilities: Str 16, Dex 9, Con 15, Int 8, Wis 9, Cha 12 \nSkills: Climb +4, Hide +0, Listen +4, Search +4, Spot +5 \nFeats: Power Attack \n \n\nClimate/Terrain: Any land and underground \nOrganization: Solitary or clan (3–30) \nChallenge Rating: 2 \nTreasure: Standard \nAlignment: Any chaotic \nAdvancement: By character class \n \nThese beings vaguely resemble humans, but have three heads, three arms, and three legs.  One of the \nthree heads will always be of a different sex from the other two and it will always be in the middle.  The \nsex of the ubue is determined by how many heads it has of one sex.  Two male heads indicates it will be \nmale and vice versa.  Due to this division of heads, there is a great deal of argument between the heads \nfrom time to time.  Sometimes these arguments are untimely, as in the middle of a battle (15% chance). \n\nUbues have pale flesh, and in all features appear as a human.  They wear animal skins, and use \nbones as hair decorations and jewelry. \n\n\n\n \nCombat \nUbues attack wildly with their weapons, or with their bare hands if they are unarmed.  There is no real skill \nor method in their combat––they attack with primal rage and savage brutality. \n\nSuperior Two–Weapon Fighting (Ex): Because each of its three heads controls an arm, the ubue \ndoes not suffer an attack penalty for attacking with three weapons. \n\n*Skills: An ubue’s three heads gives it a +4 to Listen, Spot and Search checks.  An ubue cannot be \nflanked. \n \nUbue Characters \nThe favored class of a ubue is barbarian, and all ubue chieftains are barbarians.  Female ubues have \nbeen know to become adepts, but this is rare; nearly all classed members of both sexes of this unusual \nrace are barbarians. \n \nUbue Society \n\nThe social system of the ubues is simple.  The strongest male ubue is the tribal chief.  A male ubue \ncan at any time challenge the chief for the right to be the new ruler.  If the challenger loses, he is forced to \nleave the tribe for a period of 4 seasons.  His family, if he has one, is often exiled with him.  If the chief \nloses, he simply becomes one of the village elders and will always have voice in the council. \n\nFemale ubues generally give birth to only one child at a time.  If more than one babe is born, the \ntribe’s shaman will kill one of the babies.  If one of the babes is female and the other male, it will be the \nfemale that dies, otherwise the shaman cast sticks onto the floor searching for signs from the gods as to \nwhich child to slay. \n \n\nPART 7: MAGIC ITEMS \nAnterian Brandy: A heavenly drink made by dwarves skilled in the art of brewing.  The secret of how \n\nAnterian Brandy is made is guarded as though it were worth a fortune in gold.  Since it is made by \ndwarves, it is natural for all dwarves to love this cobalt blue, naturally cool, sweet–smelling liquor.  Once \ntasted, the drinker must make a Will save (DC 25) or become addicted to it, won’t sell it and does his or \nher best to find some more.  Only elves are not affected by its habit–forming flavor, but will drink it anyway \nto enjoy the delicious taste.  Many an elf has drunk a stout hearty–drinking dwarf under the table. \n\nThe first ounce will cause the drinker to fall into a drunken stupor unless they make a Fortitude save \n(DC 25).  After recovering from the first drink, the consumer can slowly begin to drink additional amounts \nof brandy before overdoing.  After successfully drinking a gallon of the brew, the drunken stupors will \ncease, and the drinker will be able to enjoy this elixir as if it were a normal brandy. \n\nPrerequisites: Craft (brewing) DC 25, and brewer must be a dwarf who has learned the secret and \nwho has taken an oath not to reveal how it is made.  Market Price: 250 gp per bottle. \n\nHarp of Charming:  This lyre–like instrument appears to be made of crystal, and though no strings \ncan be seen, when touched, sweet clear music will be heard.  The harp’s magical properties are such \nthat, once per day, any skilled harpist playing it can calm and relax any creature listening to it if it fails a \nWill save (DC 17).  The musical effects will begin 1 round after play has begun. \n\nCaster Level: 7th; Prerequisites: Craft Wondrous Item, charm monster; Market Price: 11,200 gp. \nThe Sword of Spartusia: It functions as a +2 weapon in the hands of Spartusia’s descendant, all \n\nothers find that it will serve only at +1.  Males find the sword’s build a little too delicate and feminine, but it \nseems perfect for the hand of a strong female. \n\nBardic knowledge checks will reveal the following about this weapon: \nDC 15: The blade of this sword was crafted from a single flawless ruby.  Tales speak of a race of \n\nancient red dragon worshippers creating this sword for Spartusia because she saved their queen dragon \nfrom vengeful knights of other lands.  The sword was given a trim and womanly appearance both in size \nand beauty to match the beauty of Spartusia, and a bite that was deep to match her courage and \nstrength. \n\nDC 20: This wondrous, ruby–bladed magic sword once belonged to the legendary female warrior \nSpartusia Ericsdottir.  The sword is believed to be cursed; a curse that caused it to constantly search for a \ntrue female descent of Spartusia. The sword has had many owners, most of whom died horrible or \nembarrassing deaths.  Recently there have been stories of the sword reemerging from unknown depths, \nand it is now in the hands of a female werebear. \n\n\n\nDC 25: What little history is known about the sword tells of Spartusia being swallowed up by the \nearth.  The sword resurfaced many years later while a group of natives were burying their old chief.  The \nnew chief claimed that it was a gift from their gods to him.  However, three years later his wife murdered \nhim and his mistress with the sword and then threw the sword and herself off a cliff into the raging sea. \n\nDC 30: The sword turned up about 100 years later in a fishing village.  The whole village was burned \nto the ground by a horde of barbarians not long afterwards.  After that its fate was unknown until it came \nto be in the possession of the aforementioned werebear. \n\nThe ruby bladed sword appears valuable, but is cursed so that it cannot be sold––it must be given \naway (or thrown away).  If a character attempts to sell the weapon (no matter how carefully or \nroundabout), the sword will find its way back to the character, and the selling price will be lost.  The sword \nalso brings disaster upon any owner who is not a true descendant of Spartusia (as Aleigha is). \n\nThis weapon is an artifact, and the method of its creation is unknown, and cannot be reproduced. \n \nGLOSSARY \nAlcove: a recessed area opening from a larger room \nArras: a type of tapestry \nBattlement: a parapet with open spaces atop a wall, used for defense \nCoronet: a small jeweled crown \nIron Maiden: a torture machine with hinged halves, shaped like a human body, and with spikes on the \n\ninside \nMessage Beads: a string of colored beads, each standing for a word or phrase (the DM may want to \n\nallow rogues or characters with high intelligence a chance to crack the code, or this could be the start \nof a whole new adventure) \n\nMosaic: a picture set into a wall, floor, or ceiling, made by assembling small pieces of colored tile in a \npattern \n\nPalette: a small, flat board used for mixing paints or makeup powders \nParamour: a lover \nPallet: a straw mattress \nSconce: a wall bracket for torches \nTapestry: a fabric through which colored threads are woven to make a picture or design.

These \nmonsters, treasures and traps may be placed in areas of the dungeon that the players have already \nexplored, in the empty areas provided in the key, or they may be placed on the new maps and levels the \nDM has drawn to expand the dungeon as part of his or her on–going campaign. \n \nUPPER LEVEL ENCOUNTERS \n1.

The DM should carefully place additional treasure.  Some possible treasures are: \n \n1. Crystal chalice worth 100 gp \n2. Jeweled box (50 gp) holding 5 50 gp gems \n3. Magic Pot: heats liquid in 1–3 rounds when lid is on \n4. Music box with dancing bears worth 750 gp \n5. Oak chest of mixed coins: 2000 cp, 1500 sp, 500 gp \n6. Sack of 100 cp \n7. Sack of 400 sp \n\n\n\n8. Silver status with ruby eyes worth 350 gp \n9. Silver sword set with rubies (non–magic) worth 1000 gp \n10.  Silverware set worth 50 gp \n11.  Small dragon figure carved from a ruby worth 3000 gp \n12.  Teak coffer, locked, holding 100 sp \n \n\nTRAPS \nFireplace:  CR ¼; Reflex save (DC 10) avoids; Search (DC20); Disable Device (DC 15); this blows soot \n\nall over anyone who tries to search it. \nOil Spray:  CR ½; Reflex save (DC 10) avoids; Search (DC20); Disable Device (DC 20); this covers the \n\nfloor and characters may slip and fall down.  This is most effective when used on an incline (–2 \nconditional modifier to the Reflex save) leading to a pit trap. \n\nGlowing Gem:  CR 1; Search (DC 25); Disable Device (DC 26); this shrieks when touched, as per a \nmagic mouth spell, causing a wandering monster check, and shattering all flasks and vials that do not \nsave vs. Spells \n\nWeak Floor:  CR ½; no attack roll necessary (1d6); Reflex save (DC 20) avoids; Search (DC 22); Disable \nDevice (DC 20); collapses when stepped on and drops the character 10'. \n\nStatue:  CR 1; Will save (DC 16) avoids; Search DC 25; Disable Device (DC 26); causes fear when \ntouched. \n\nFlypaper Rug:  CR ½; Reflex save (DC 10) avoids; Strength check (DC 10) to escape; anyone touching \nit is stuck unless doused with wine, oil, etc. \n\nMagic Gong:  CR 1; Search (DC 25); Disable Device (DC 20); sounds when approached—one turn later, \nthe party will encounter 1d4+1 hobgoblins. \n\nShrink Gas:  CR 2; Will save (DC 15) negates; those caught in gas must save or shrink to 6” tall (effects \nlast one hour). \n\nFlash Trap:  CR 1; Reflex save (DC 11) avoids; Search (DC 20); Disable Device (DC 20); characters \nlooking at this must save or be blinded 2–12 rounds. \n\nPit Trap:  CR ½; no attack roll necessary (1d6); Reflex save (DC 20) avoids; Search (DC 20); Disable \nDevice (DC 20); collapses when stepped on and drops the character 10'. \n\nGas Vent:  CR ½; Fortitude save (DC 12) avoids; Search (DC 20); Disable Device (D 20); room closes \nand party has 1d4+1 rounds to locate and block the vent or go to sleep for 2–12 turns \n\nIron Door/Portcullis: CR ½; Search (DC 20); Disable Device (DC 20); slams shut behind party; they \nmust find a hidden lever to open it, Search (DC 20) to find. \n\n \nNAMES \n\nPart of the fun of the game is making up names for the characters.  The DM should always keep a list of \nnames handy, for there is no telling when a NPC will become important.  A name gives the players \nsomething to identify with.  Rescuing a maiden is not nearly as much fun as rescuing Megan, beautiful \nfoster daughter of the old witch–woman, who loves Sir Rupert of the Eastern Marches . . . \n\nNames often come from a character’s family’s work (Tanner), looks (Hrolf Bluetooth) or home area \n(Lady Westford).  Titles can also be used (Father Sebastian, Leif the Lucky). \n\nIf you have trouble making up names, try getting a book on names from the library (like books on \nnaming babies).  This may explain how names are created, in addition to having some you can use.  \nNames can also be taken from fiction books, especially fantasy or historical novels.  \n\nAnother way to find names to use is to get them from a map.  For example, when looking for a name \nfor a bandit chieftain, the DM might have pulled out a map of Malaya and seen the city, Jitra.  Thus the \nchieftain might be named One–Eyed Jitra, or Jitra the Merciless.  Letters can be added or changed: Jittra \nor Jutra.  The important thing is to get a name you like the sound of. \n \n\nSPECIAL MONSTER REACTIONS \nThe monsters in this module have special reactions to each other.  The DM can either use these or make \nup some he or she likes better.  These reactions are: \n\nAdepts: These serve the cleric, Catharandamus (Upper Level).  They will attempt to warn him of \nintruders without leading the party to room UL 28.  They will aid the goblins and the barbarians if there is \na fight, but their first loyalty is to their master, Catharandamus. \n\n\n\nBandits: As part of their joining the local bandit gang, these thieves must steal something valuable \nfrom the ruins.  The bandits will be unhappy with adventurers invading their testing ground and may take \naction if the party is not too strong.  (The DM may also change this encounter to one with a scouting party \nfrom the invading army.) \n\nBarbarians: These barbarians wear wolf skins and worship the “Great Bear” (the werebear Aleigha, \nsee Upper Level 28).  They will attack the “wolf soldiers” (scouting parties) on sight, and almost anything \nelse when in battle rage.  However, they will never attack Aleigha, and will fight to the death in her \ndefense.  Their actions are unpredictable, though prone to violence. \n\nGoblins/Hobgoblins: These creatures usually run errands for Catharandamus.  They do not like his \ndwarven retainers, but their fear of the cleric’s power keeps them from attacking the dwarves outright.  \nCatharandamus keeps the goblins around to balance off the barbarians—he doesn’t trust Aleigha.  The \ngoblins and barbarians don’t like each other, and there is a certain amount of brawling and backstabbing \nwhen their leaders are not watching. \n\nKobolds/Orcs: These nasty creatures have lairs near the palace.  They go into the ruins occasionally \nto steal what they can.  They don’t get along well with the goblins or with each other; and they certainly \ndon’t mind taking a few human heads when they get the chance!  (There is a chance that Catharandamus \nis trying to get the goblins, kobolds, and orcs to work together—to further his evil plans—but this is left to \nthe DM.) \n\nUbues: These odd creatures live in the palace.  They mainly want to be left alone, but will fiercely \ndefend themselves and their territory if attacked.  They know of the cleric Catharandamus, but not of his \nplans.  Depending on how they are approached and what the party does, the ubues may: try to play the \nparty off against the cleric, ask the cleric for help against the party, or even help the party against \nCatharandamus, if asked!  It is important that ubue reactions are not based on random dice rolls, but on \nlogical responses to party actions (and note that having “weird”—but consistent—logic could be fun!). \n\nWolf Soldiers:  These are soldiers from a nearby kingdom who have heard the legends of the Palace \nof the Silver Princess.  Several of their comrades came here earlier to investigate the palace and never \nreturned (they are the corpses in room EL 7).  The kingdom they come from, and how they react to the \ncharacters, is up to the DM. \n \n\nMAJOR PERSONALITIES \nThe DM should develop these personalities and think about what they will do before the game starts.  \nThey are in Upper Level 28, and can be the most interesting encounters if DMed well.  If the party is very \nstrong, these characters should be reinforced with other characters (adepts, barbarians, goblins, and \nhobgoblins) to give the party a tough fight if things go that way.  (A DM who isn’t sure how strong the \nparty is might secretly try a “solo” combat between the player’s characters and these NPCs before \nrunning the party through this area.  Practice combats where the DM runs both sides help the DM decide \nhow strong to make an encounter area.)  \n\nCatharandamus.   This cleric is the strongest NPC in the module.  He is careful and clever.  He will \nnot fully trust anyone and will always have an escape or some other plan ready.  (The DM should decide \nwhat he will do before any action develops—especially what he would do if the party suddenly attacks).  \n\nCatharandamus uses people.  He does not mind seeing other characters die if it helps his own plans, \nbut he will not carelessly kill someone who might be useful later.  He will not reveal why he is here, \nthough he may lie about it (perhaps he is trying to use this area as a power base, perhaps he is hiding \nfrom the revenge of D’hmis, or perhaps he is looking for secret knowledge or powerful magic buried in the \ncollapsed tunnels under the palace).  He has an odd sense of humor and is very, very dangerous. \n\nAliegha.  This pretty young adventuress was bitten by a werebear and infected with lycanthropy early \nin her life.  Since then she has been drifting from place to place.  She moves on each time the local \npeasants or soldiers come too close to discovering her secret. \n\nCatharandamus learned of her secret and realized she would be a powerful servant.  She now looks \non him as a kindly father figure and will fight to protect him.  (Catharandamus doesn’t really care about \nher, though he is careful no to let her know this).  She owns the magic Sword of Spartusia and is a \ndescendant of the original owner (see Magic Items, p 29). \n\nBoron and Xyzom.  These dwarves are Catharandamus’ retainers.  They serve as his bodyguards \nand he protects them from the goblins.  No one knows why they are here, but they may be outcasts who \nhave joined Catharandamus for loot.  Perhaps he has some kind of a hold on them or has tricked them \ninto serving him.  They might even have goals of their own—spying for the Dwarven King, looking for a \n\n\n\nprecious dwarven treasure buried below the palace, and so on.  The DM should work out something \ninteresting. \n \n\nREADY–TO–PLAY CHARACTERS \nThe following first level characters are given so new players can start play quickly.  Armor Class and hit \npoints have already been adjusted for Dexterity and Constitution.  The DM can also use these characters \nas NPCs if desired.

Should you have any questions \nor comments, please feel free to send an \nemail to me at \nchristianmichael.dutton@worldnet.att.net \n(emails with attachments are automatically \ndeleted—sorry!). \n \nIntroduction \n \n\nMenstaugher Manor has always \nbeen haunted, but when two young giant \nboys decide to prove their bravery by \ngoing into the house, the city watch is very \nconcerned to retrieve the boys lest the \npolitical backlash turn into something \nmore than they bargained for!  \n \n\nThis is an introductory adventure \nusing Monte Cook’s Arcana Unearthed: A \nVariant Player’s Handbook. DM’s should be \nfamiliar with that book as converting to \neither a 3e or 3.5 ed module may be \nchallenging. This module is designed for a \nparty of four characters at 1st level, 2nd at \nthe most, but the DM can easily scale it to \nhigher levels by introducing more \nmonsters or advancing the ones currently \nin the module. \n \nDM’s Background \n \n\nLucius Menstaugher was a great \nnoble and a kind human man.  He fought \nmany wars against other petty kingdoms \nthat declared themselves independent of \n\nthe giants’ rule, but never lasted.  Lucius \nwas responsible for financing great fleets \nof merchant ships to ply the coastal lanes \nto conduct trade and commerce wherever \nthere was a port.  Many times Lucius \nhimself would lead mariners to stop pirate \nincursions against Cat Watch and his fleet.  \nThe city of Cat Watch dedicated a park and \nbuilt a statue in his honor for all the great \ndeeds he’s done for the people of Cat \nWatch.  Then one day, it all changed.   \n\nLucius was finally routing the \npirates whose members were humanoid \nrats and eyes that glowed blood red.  \nLucius fought many battles, but chased \none of the ships as it made its way back to \nits home berth on an island known as Isle \nof the Blood Red Moon.  Lucius was \ndetermined to exterminate the pirate’s \nhaven once and for all, but did not expect \nto find more than even his soul could bear.   \n\nLucius succeeded in killing the rat \nmen to the last, and discovered the vast \ntreasures the pirates have been hoarding \nfor years.  But the greatest treasures Lucius \nfound was not in gold or silver or jewels, \nbut in books.  He found a small library of \nold books written in a long dead language.  \nLucius was always a bookworm and \ntranslating old texts was a great passion of \nhis.  He couldn’t resist and took the books; \nhowever one of them was cursed with \nmalevolence—The Book of Nex Volume I.  \n\nOn the voyage home, Lucius spent \nhis time studying the ancient text of The \nBook of Nex.  He immediately knew of it as \na book of occultic carnal practices, but he \ncouldn’t resist delving into its pages.  \nLucius easily found a reference text and \ntranslated the pages only to discover the \nmind-shattering horrors those pages \ncontained were too much for him and the \nbook bent him to its will. \n\nThe murders then began. \n\n1 \n\nmailto:christianmichael.dutton@worldnet.att.net\n\n\nThe Curse of Menstaugher Manor \n\nFour crewmen, one by one each \nnight were found brutally and savagely \nmurdered. The crew thought they were \ncursed for taking the pirates treasure and \nsought to appease the fates by throwing \nthe treasure down into the bottom of the \nocean but Lucius wouldn’t allow them.  \nInstead, Lucius fostered resentment and \nanger among the senior officers and about \na day before the ship arrived at port, part \nof the crew who were unlucky to have \ngiven the smallest of slights to the captain \nbeen accused of the murders.  With the \ncrew as superstitious as it was, they \nwasted no time executing the accused crew \nmembers and sent their bodies down the \nsea. \n\nLucius arrived at Cat Watch the \nnext day feeling empowered.  He \ndisappeared from public view by putting \nbars on his windows and boarding them \nup to keep visitors out. Three months later, \ndisappearances of homeless, ladies-of-the-\nevening, and the disadvantaged were \noccurring at alarming rates. \n\nRumors of the cursed treasure \nbegan to surface, Lucius’ strange behavior, \nand the disappearances was enough that \nthe Cat Watch Magistrate ordered an \ninvestigation to see if there was a \nconnection.   \n\nThe investigation was hampered by \ninternal politics, but after two months (and \n30 bodies and body parts later found \nwashing out from the sewers), a quickling \nfaen City Watch private by the name of \nJeressin Farrowstar went against orders \nand broke into Menstaugher Manor \nthinking the vital clues would be there.  \nNot only did he find the clues he needed, \nhe found the cause of all the \ndisappearances and murders.   \n\nThe stench of blood and rot was too \nstrong.  The servants of the manor had \nbeen mutilated and savagely cut apart like \n\nthe other murders. Instead of fleeing and \nalerting his superiors, Private Jeressin \nfound courage and searched the manor for \nLucius.  Jeressin found him torturing the \nlatest of his victims, a homeless man from \nHumantown.  Lucius immediately became \naware of Jeressin’s presence and the \ngraceful and kind noble that the city of Cat \nWatch knew and loved was no where to be \nfound in the abomination that loomed \nbefore Jeressin.   \n\nA fight ensued and Lucius was too \nmuch of a match even in his maddened \nstate for Private Jeressin.  Then Kertick, \nGod of Blind Dumb Luck and Head \nAccidents, came and granted a Private \nJeressin a boon and a second chance at life \n(at least Private Jeressin believes this to be \nthe case).   \n\nLucius slipped and hit his head on a \ntable and was out cold. \n\nThe authorities arrived to arrest \nPrivate Jeressin (one of his fellow watches \nsnitched on him) for breaking and \nentering, but upon seeing that Lucius was \nbehind the crimes that plagued the city he \nended up being heralded as a hero.  \n At the trial, magical divination \ndetermined that Lucius Menstaugher was \ncursed, but nothing could cure him.  The \npeople cried for blood and the Magistrate \nwas forced to act.  They hanged Lucius and \nwere going to bury his body in the \nmorning, but the corpse was not there \ncome dawn.  The Magistrate ordered the \nbody to be found.  After several hours of \nsearching no one could find any trace, \nmagical or physical to indicate what \nhappened to the body.  Divinations failed \nto determine what happened and the \nmatter was put to rest.  Menstaugher \nManor was to be seized, but the rumors of \nthe curse were too great for the fearful \nWatch that they left the place alone. \n That was 20 years ago. \n\n2 \n\n\n\nThe Curse of Menstaugher Manor \n\n Two boys, Ka-Bailud and Lu-Merge \nare the sons of middle nobles of influence \nin the city of Cat Watch.  Their fathers are \nfierce enemies, but circumstances allowed \nthese youngsters to be best friends when \nnot at their studies by sneaking out and \npretending to be freemen.  With dreams of \nbecoming adventurers and seeking out \nglory and riches, they dared each other to \nenter the Menstaugher Manor, for they did \nnot believe in the stories their parents and \nnannies told them to scare them into \nbehaving themselves.  They were not \nheard from again. \n That was three days ago. \n High Captain Jeressin Farrowstar \n(now a spryte) has been tasked to find the \nboys, but the pressure is mounting \nbetween the two nobles, because a slip-up \nto either of them can cost him his career, \nnot to mention that there are other \ninterested parties who would spring upon \nthis opportunity should the fathers’ \nproblems become public.  Ja-Rein has been \nleaning on him and has demanded that he \nround up some “adventurer types” and \nbring them to his manor in the Noble \nTalon.      \n High Captain Jeressin wonders \nwhere he’ll find some “adventurer types” \nwithout making this a public spectacle, he \ncan’t go through the guilds on this one. \nThis is when he looks out the window of \nthe Watch Barracks and sees the PC’s \nwalking by in the street.. \n Hmmm.....this has to be work of Dorica, \nGoddess of Finding Adventurers in a Pinch, \nthinks the good captain. \n \n \n \n \nOther Problems \n \n\n Aside from the political game being \nplayed here between the two nobles and \nthe High Captain, there are two other \nparties who have learned of the plight of \nthe two young boys and are interested in \nfinding them as well. In addition to these \n“interested parties”, Lucius himself still \nexists, though as a minion of The Book of \nNex.  It is highly likely that the PC’s will \nencounter members of these other parties, \nand definitely Lucius, which can get quite \ndangerous. \n \nThe Heart and Eyes Guild \n This group of cutthroats, \nscallywags, skulkers, and assassins are \nextremely feared.  While they are officially \noutlawed and hunted on sight by the local \nWatch and Militia, they are too clever and \npowerful to be broken.  Many of the \nranking members of this “guild of \nassassins” are mysterious and take great \nsteps to prevent any magical or normal \ninvestigations to learn of their identities.  \nMany of the higher ranking nobles profess \nthat the guild doesn’t exist, but they fool \nno one, and often make deals with such \nlowlifes to take care of certain “problems”.  \nWhen the Heart and Eyes (also called the \nBody-takers) go to work, they can make \nsure that someone will be buried in an \nunmarked grave in the Remembrance \nTalon before dawn the next day and never \nbe found again.  Sometimes they will leave \na message for others when a body washes \nout in the ocean from the sewers (while the \nmurder of this circumstance is common, \nthe removal of the heart and eyes is not, \nthus attributes to their grisly name).  The \nGuild has sent a few unknowing agents (a \nbunch of thugs called the Reaver Gang) to \nfind the boys.  If the Reaver Gang finds the \nboys, they are to kill them at once (this is to \navenge an insult that both of the nobles \nhad given the guild).   \n\n3 \n\n\n\nThe Curse of Menstaugher Manor \n\nIf any of the members of the Reaver \nGang is caught, they will be found dead in \ntheir cells before any questioning can \noccur.  If the PC’s take it upon themselves \nto question any caught members of the \ngang before they are taken off to the \nBarracks, they can only be told that a “dark \ncloaked” man told them to do the job and \npaid them 100 gp each and promised 100 \ngp more upon proof of their deaths. \n\n  \nMerkan the Wildstrider \n \n Merkan is a male litorian who has a \npersonal score to settle with one of the \nnobles, Lir-Tan.  Merkan is a descendant \nfrom a local tribe of litorians and Lir-Tan is \nan arms dealer that promised the tribe to \ndeal with a rival litorian tribe that were \nattacking their livestock and hunting their \nlands.  He promised them swords, spears, \nand great bows to deal with their enemies \nand with all the jewelry of their tribe, \nbought them.   \n The weapons were junk. \n As fate would play, the rival litorian \ntribe invading that morning was \nbrandishing new weapons as well, but it \nbecame evident that Lir-Tan played both \nsides as the weapons he sold to both \nparties broke and failed with little \nbloodshed to either tribe.  The two tribes \nmade peace that night and sent Merkan \nand two of his brothers as emissaries to go \nto the city and present their case before the \nMagistrate.  Merkan and his two brothers \nswore oaths before the elders of the two \ntribes to bring Lir-Tan to justice.   \n The Magistrate heard their case and \nordered an investigation.  Two days later, \nthe investigation concluded with no \ncharges brought against Lir-Tan.  It \nseemed that Lir-Tan managed to bribe \nmore than one person to end the \ninvestigation. \n\n Lir-Tan would not let the litorians \ngo back to their tribes to later rise up or \nseek revenge, so he sent some hired goons \nto care of them, but the litorians were \nexpecting an attack.  Unfortunately, \nMerkan’s brothers died trying to buy him \ntime to escape.  Later that day, Merkan \nwas considered a prime suspect in his \nbrother’s murders and has been on the run \nfrom the City Militia and City Watch ever \nsince.  He knows that if he is ever caught, \nhe will die in their prison.  Merkan has \nmanaged to maintain a low profile, mainly \neking out an existence in Humantown, the \nsewers, and some parts of Old Undercity.  \nHe dreams of the day of personally making \nLir-Tan beg for his life before he rips out \nthe giant’s throat.  \n Merkan discovered that one of Lir-\nTan’s sons, the youngest, has been \nsneaking off to go play with another giant \nchild.  An opportunity indeed!  If he can \nnab the child, it will be the bargaining chip \nhe will have to make Lir-Tan come to him \non his terms. \n Merkan’s interaction with the party \nwill not be one of confrontation unless he \nhas run out of options.  He will attempt to \npose as one of the City Watch (using a \nstolen cloak and badge from an encounter \na long time ago when he first became an \noutlaw) and will make a claim to return \none of the children immediately back to his \nfather should the PC’s safely recover the \nboys. \n \nLucius the Cursed Shadow \n \n The Book of Nex Volume I not only \ncorrupted Lucius’ mind, but managed to \ntake his soul as well. Upon Lucius’ death, \nhis soul and truename were bound to the \nbook and it called the spirit of Lucius into a \nshadowy substance ready to wreck \nhavoc—a cursed shadow. Unfortunately, \n\n4 \n\n\n\nThe Curse of Menstaugher Manor \n\nLucius was bound to the manor and \ncannot leave its grounds, so has been \nwaiting there for 20 years until two young \ngiant nobles came prying out the boards \nblocking the main doors.... \n \nGetting the PC’s Involved \n \nThe party is in Cat Watch because of a \nmyriad of reasons that Cat Watch offers \nand its reputation for providing adventure.  \nAny of these hooks can be of use to bring \nthe PC’s together or if they are traveling \ntogether already, to give them motivation \nfor being here in Cat Watch. \n\n• The PC’s will need work as \nadventurers or mercenaries and \nneed to find the local guildhalls to \npetition to be let in, so they can find \nemployment contracts (you cannot \nwork as an adventurer or mercenary \nwithout belonging to a guild); \nhowever, they got lost from the \nlousy directions a merchant or a \nfreeman, or passerby gave them to \nfind the guildhall they’re looking \nfor.  This will lead directly to Scene \n1 (see below). \n\n• There is a local festival called the \nGreat Passing that is five days of \nfeasting, ceremonies, and \ncelebrations.  People come from all \naround the region to take part in the \nceremonies.  The PC’s may be \ninterested in taking part in the \nceremonies or feasting, but there is \nno room at any of the inns and if \nthey haven’t any coin, the City \nWatch may be able to put them up \nfor free if they’re willing to work \nduring part of the festival as extra \nguards and patrols.  In this case the \nPC’s are heading toward the Watch \nBarrack to make arrangements.  \n\n• The PC’s are here to learn new skills \nand access new spells by petitioning \nthe various learning institutions in \nthe Sossita Rinturia (The Learned \nTalon); however, they got lost. \n\n• If any the PC’s have a character \nbackground, the DM may want to \ntie in an aspect of that background \nto being here in the city (for \nexample, the DM tells a player, \n“You’re father’s killer was seen \nbooking a coach passage toward the \ncity of Cat Watch.  Obviously, such \na haven for shady dealings and \ntreachery, this is of no surprise that \nyou may finally catch the killer \nhere”).  \n\n \nSetting \n \n\nThe City of Cat Watch, a small \nburgeoning coastal city bustling with \ntrade, commerce, and learning, where one \ncan come to learn a trade in the guilds, \nlearn spellcraft at the Stedia Migicka ne \nUniversa (University of Magical Studies), \nlearn art at the Collogia (The College), learn \nthe art of war at the Guild of Nine Swords, \nor learn watercraft.  It is also a dangerous \ncity rife with political intrigue, factions \nwithin factions, plots within plots, where \nassassination, blackmail, and other \nlarcenous pursuits are commodities of \ntheir own, but while this city is rife with \ncorruption, it maintains a strong law and \norder.  It is a city built atop of ancient ruins \nof the evil dramojh hidden beneath its \nsewers, and many ruins dot the \ncountryside all the way to the mountains \nand beyond.  \n\nThe DM can set the adventure in \nany city along a coastline for her campaign \nin either the lands of the Diamond Throne \nor in a campaign of her own design using \nthe setting of Arcana Unearthed. \n\n5 \n\n\n\nThe Curse of Menstaugher Manor \n\n \nBrief Background of Cat Watch \n \n The City of Cat Watch is so named \nfor the Litorians who used to farm and \nhunt the lands before the dramojh came \nand drove them off their pastures and built \na horrendous city of bellowing smoke and \nmetal using human slaves.   \n For years the litorians would watch \nthe city from their mountain retreats and \npasses, and ambush dramojh hunting \nparties. When the giants came to the \ncontinent and freed the humans and other \nraces from their dramojh masters, the \nlitorians were the first to lead an army into \nthe city walls and bring the city down.  The \ngreat destruction that followed allowed the \nlitorians to take back their land until the \ngiants settled into the city and began to \nrebuild it.   \n The litorians feeling that the giants \nmight drive them off their lands like the \nprevious rulers were cautious, but the \ngiants sent envoys to the various scattered \ntribes to make peace with the tribes, and \ntold the great cat people they will not \ndespoil their land.  Many of the litorian \ntribes accepted the offer and came from the \nhidden mountain passes and hideaways, \nwhile some did not were very suspicious \nof the giants and have remained there \nsince then.  \n The giants felt that the litorians \nwere going to hold them to their pledge \nand they always felt that were watched \nwherever the giants trod.  Many of the \ngiants who settled in the dramojh ruin \nalways felt that a pair of eyes—catlike—\nwere upon them, thus when the first \ncouncil convened in the heart of the ruined \npalace, they named the city Cat Watch to \nremind them of their pledge and \nfriendship to the litorians. \n\n One hundred years later, a great \ndramojh of power known only as Nex \nreturned and was determined to make the \ngiants pay.  Nex ripped the land apart with \nhis great and destructive spells and it took \nthe collective magical might of the giants \nand other races to keep those spells from \noutright destroying the city, but the \ndramojh’s magic wracked the city to sink \nand the part of the peninsula it rested on \nwas ripped away so that now the city of \nCat Watch was along a coastline.  Many of \nthe old structures collapsed and were \nburied as they sank, but in a final battle \nNex was banished to a prison plane.  The \ncity had to be rebuilt again. \n Over time, the giants have ruled the \ncity peacefully, but the evil of the relics \nburied by the former dramojh masters \nweigh on the hearts of many and one \ncannot stay the stink of such evil when \nthey live in the bowel of it.  It changes a \nman and makes the heart grow dark. \n Two hundred years ago, political \nstrife began wrecking the city apart as \nguilds, nobles, mercenaries went at each \nothers throats in open and covert \nbloodshed.  No place was safe anymore \nand no one walked anywhere without \ncarrying a weapon they did not know how \nto use. \n Then a prophet came. \n Jodidiah was a simple runechild \nwho was once a sibbecai.  He prophesied \nthat the bowels of the city would rupture \nand that the blood of the city will flow into \nthe ocean killing the sea life all around it \nunless a hero comes and stay the evil of the \ncoming darkness.  A hero did come, a great \nlitorian by the name Rashikarr, a warrior \nof great skill always bringing light to \nwherever there was darkness, for the city \nof Cat Watch was at the brink to be \nenveloped in its dark shroud once and for \nall. \n\n6 \n\n\n\nThe Curse of Menstaugher Manor \n\n Rashikarr sought out all the agents \nof strife and darkness, and rooted them out \nin the Old Undercity.  In the battles against \nthe darkness, many of the council rulers, \nguildmasters, and powerful nobility were \neither pawns of the evil or made last \nstands with Rashikarr, for in the end only \nRashikarr was left standing.  This brought \npeace and Rashikarr found himself the \nleader of the city as no one could contest \nhis authority and his bravery.  Rashikarr \nknew that he only staved off the inevitable \ngiven the fact that the relics of the past still \nlay hidden, but he established two things \nthat the city has to this day in hopes that \nthe future generations would be strong \nenough (stronger than he) to banish the \ndarkness forever. He established: \n 1. The city be ruled by a Magistrate \n\nwho must work to the greater good \nof the city regardless of personal \nsacrifice. \n\n 2. An order of champions \nestablished to serve the city in its \ndarkest hour.   \n\n Rashikarr died only a couple of \nyears later, the darkness that he fought \ntook too much out of him.  The city raised \na great monument to him and entombed \nhim within it. The monument rests on a \nhill that overlooks the city and stands to \nthis day. \n Rashikarr brought peace to this day, \nbut even his sacrifice is beginning to \nbecome in vain as again darkness finds a \nway to live on and the city is again ripe \nwith political strife.  While it’s not as overt \nas the last time 200 years ago, people who \nmake enemies can find their bodies \nwashing out into the ocean from the \nsewers the next day if they are not careful. \n \nDivisions of the City and City Stats \n  \n\n The city of Cat Watch is a walled \ncity with each ward also walled.  The city \nis partly sunken that rests even with the \ncoastline and the rest of the coastline has \nbeen worked that it’s easy to take carts \nback and forth from the higher elevated \nparts of the city to the lower parts.  The \ncity has twelve wards (called “talons” \nthough the etymology of this word has \nbeen lost).  The talons in no particular \nimportance are: \n\n1. West Talon—entrance into the city \nand usually a travelers quarter of \ninns and way stations. \n\n2. Freeman’s Quarter—mostly \nadventurers and mercenaries live \nhere. \n\n3. Humantown—a very poor and \nviolent ward, but so aptly named \nbecause most of the population is \nhuman. The talon use to have \nanother name, but only the court \nscribes know what it used to be \ncalled. \n\n4. Noble Talon—talon of the nobility. \n5. Guild Talon—talon of the guilds. \n6. Merchant Talon—talon of the \n\nbazaars and markets. \n7. Remembrance Talon—talon of \n\nshrines, cemeteries, and \nmausoleums to honor the dead, the \nfates, and the many gods of the \nfaen. \n\n8. High Talon—the smallest talon, but \nwhere the city is governed. \n\n9. The Low Talon—the talon of the \ndocks, warehouses, and ships. \n\n10. Sossita Rinturia (The Learned \nTalon)—talon of the Stedia Migicka \nne Universa (University of Magical \nStudies), the Collogia (The College), \nand The White Library (a massive \nlibrary made of white marble). \nOther places of learning are here in \nthis talon. \n\n7 \n\n\n\nThe Curse of Menstaugher Manor \n\n11. Smokestack Village—this talon is a \nward of blacksmiths, metal smiths, \nand workers of all metals precious \nand mundane. \n\n12. The Watch Talon—the talon that \nhouses most of the City Watch and \nthe City Militia. \n\n \nCity of Cat Watch (Large City): \nConventional /  Nonstandard; 40,000 gp \nlimit; Assets 2 million gp; Population \n12,200 (including 1,200 troops and City \nWatch); Mixed (giant 10%, humans 30%, \nlitorians 15%, sibbecai 15%, loreson faen \n18%, quickling faen 3%, sprites 3%, \nrunechildren 2%, verrik 2%, mojh 1%, \nother 1%). \nAuthority Figures: Magistrate Kar-Farlass, \nmale giant Giant 3/Mage Blade \n7/Magister 2 (ruler of the city of Cat \nWatch); High Captain of the Watch \nJeressin Farrowstar, male spryte Spryte \n3/Unfettered 12 (commanding officer of \nthe City Watch); High General Deddina the \nRed, female litorian Warmain 10 (general \nof the City Militia) \n \nScene 1: You’re Under Arrest in the Name \nof the Magistrate! \n \nSet up—the PC’s are either coming down \nthe road together (they might know each \nother) or separately coming from different \ndirections, but close enough to pass one \nanother by to be considered a group when \nthe guards call out for them to stop from \nthe Watch Barracks’ gates. \n \n The pounding rain has finally \nstopped and you can look up to get your \nbearings while walking down the city \nstreets of Cat Watch.  The rain has only \nmade the city of shady dealings, fast \ntreachery, and an assassin’s blade all the \ngloomier and you think that it would be \n\nvery preferable to be in a warm room with \ngood ale right now.  Your thoughts are \ninterrupted as you slosh through the mud \nof the wide street surrounded by stone \nwalls and dark looking military structures.  \nYou had hoped that the rain would at least \ncarry away the stench of horse offal and \nother more vile airs, but it only feels even \nworse.  Suddenly a whistle to your left \nblows and looking in the direction you see \nthe walled compound known as the Watch \nBarracks, apparently the home of the City \nWatch, the local militia, or maybe both. \nThe outer gates open and out come some \nthirty troops toward you, each wearing the \ngarb of the City Watch.  One of them, a \nsibbecai dressed in light armor and bright \ncolorful tunics points at all of you and \nbarks, “All of you must stop in the name of \nthe High Magistrate.  Resist, and you’ll be \nplaced under arrest!” \n \n The DM should immediately tell the \nPC’s that the guards look as if they want to \ntalk, and not arrest anyone, because they \ntypically will brandish weapons and \nmanacles for arrests, but haven’t done \neither. \n The sibbecai, Blue Sergeant Ferros \nMordikai, is a serious and loyal follower of \nCaptain Jeressin, and will execute his \nduties to the city without question.  Ferros \nwill order the PC’s that he’s under direct \norders to bring them before the High \nCaptain who requests an audience with \nthem.  Ferros will look at the PC’s weapons \nto make sure they are peace bonded (tying \nup the weapons to make sure they aren’t \nquickly drawn in combat).  If there is any \nweapon larger than a dagger that isn’t \npeace bonded, Ferros will order his troops \nto peace bond the PC’s weapon (the PC’s \naren’t allowed to do this themselves).  If \nany PC refuses to have their weapon peace \nbonded, Ferros will offer them a choice of \n\n8 \n\n\n\nThe Curse of Menstaugher Manor \n\nhaving their weapon confiscated or have it \npeace bonded. \n Ferros will not mess with \nthreatening or disrespectful characters.  If \nany of the party intends to fight their way \nout of the situation, refuse to comply with \nFerros’ orders, or bluff their way out, \nFerros will give them a warning and the \nPC’s will notice that there are archers \nalong the walls as well in addition to the 30 \ntroops cutting off their exits.  If any of the \nparty intends to fight, well, at least the \nadventure was short.... \n If the party is very talkative and \nlawfully surrenders to Ferros’ authority, \nFerros becomes very friendly and states \nthat they have been selected for a mission \nof great importance.  Ferros will not say \nmore except all will be revealed when they \nmeet the High Captain. \n It takes a full 10 minutes to reach \nthe High Captain’s Office which has a \nsmall foyer to seat guests.  Ferros will ask \nthe PC’s to surrender their weapons at this \npoint with the promise they will be \npromptly returned as soon as their meeting \nwith the High Captain has concluded. \n  \n After having your weapons taken, \nthe City Watch provide you with warm \ncloaks and take your damp ones to dry by \na nearby fire place. The double mahogany \ndoors to the High Captain’s Office, opens \nand out flutters a small winged creature \nthat could only be a spryte.  The guards \nand the sergeant immediately snap to \nattention and salute the spryte. The male \nspryte has the regal features of a hawk and \nwears the dark crested blues of the City \nWatch and a great badge (by spryte \nstandards) that indicates he is a very high-\nranking person in the City Watch. \n The figure examines each of you \nwith a stern look of resolution and motions \nto Blue Sergeant Ferros.  “Blue Sergeant, \n\nyou are taking our guests via carriage to \nJa-Rein Hall.  I shall join you shortly to ride \nthere,” the spryte commands. \n\nLooking to you, the spryte says, \n“Hail travelers and welcome to the City of \nCat Watch should you be new to our fair \ncity.  I am High Captain Jeressin \nFarrowstar.  I am in need of people of your \nsort who would be willing to earn some \ngold coin should you hear out our good \npatron,” the spryte speaks. \n “Blue Sergeant Ferros will escort \nyou to the carriage.  I see that he has \nconfiscated your weapons.  They will not \nbe returned at this moment until our \nbusiness has been concluded, but I assure \nyou that after the meeting at Ja-Rein Hall, \nyou will have them returned to you along \nwith any other belongings.  I shall join you \nin a few minutes. That is all.” Immediately \nthe spryte flutters back into his office and \ntwo guards close the doors. \n Blue Sergeant Ferros looks at you as \nif a silent command was given for you to \nfollow him.   \n \nScene 2: Ja-Rein Hall \n \nSet-up—the PC’s are then taken by \ncarriage to the walled talon of the Noble’s \nTalon and in a few short minutes they \narrive at a garish and opulent manor of a \nnoble.  The front outer wall near the \nentrance gate bears a large inscription in \nCommon reading, “Ja-Rein Hall”. \n The PC’s are then taken to a small \nstudy and after a few minutes, High \nCaptain Jeressin and a giant dressed in \nnoble refinement will enter the room \n \n Your wait hasn’t been long as the \ndoors to the small study opens and High \nCaptain Jeressin Farrowstar enters along \nwith and a male giant of massive girth \ndressed in noble refinement.  Something \n\n9 \n\n\n\nThe Curse of Menstaugher Manor \n\ntells you this is the owner of this large \nhouse. \n The giant looks at you with a bit of \ndisdain—no, disgust, and then looks at the \nCaptain, who gives a shrug and a weak \nsmile. A small sneer can be seen from the \ngiant, but then turns to you. \n The giant speaks in a rough tone, \n“Do you know who I am?  Let me tell you \nwho I am.  I am the noble who given of  \ncircumstances can make miserable lives \nsuch as yours very comfortable or with a \nsimple command, can make miserable \nlives such as yours spend a good deal of \ntime in the dungeon, so listen very \ncarefully to what I have to propose.” \n “My youngest son, Ka-Bailud, has \nrun off and is missing.  I am presuming he \nis on one of his typical boyhood \nadventures with his friend, a despicable \nand detestable sort that goes by the name \nof Lu-Merge.  This Lu-Merge is a trouble \nmaker and probably put some fool idea in \nmy son to go gallivanting about the town \nlike typically young noble boys like to do, \nbut Ka-Bailud is too young to be doing this \nsort of thing, and I need him found quietly, \nand returned home discreetly.  As a noble, \nI’m involved in many of the politics of the \ncity and have many enemies, some who \nwould not hesitate to find my son before I \ndo and use him as a bargaining token in \nsome trade discussion or important noble \nbusiness that rabble like you would have \nno ability to comprehend.” \n “I need you to find my son, bring \nhim back, and I shall give you 50 gold \nkings each for your effort. If you also bring \nme that scallywag that my son has been \nhanging out with, Lu-Merge, I will top you \noff with an extra 10 gold kings each.  You \nare free to refuse, but should you do, I will \nsee to it that your next employment \nopportunities with any of the guilds are at \n\nthe Dung Sweepers and Sewer Cleaners \nGuild”. \n With that, the giant waves you \naway for a moment so that he can speak \nwith High Captain Jeressin in private. \n \nIf the PC’s Accept the Offer \n  \n Ja-Rein will have High Captain \nJeressin issue them a pass to enter any of \nthe talons after nightfall and sternly warns \nthem that they are to keep their mission \nvitally secret and TELL NO ONE.  Most of \nall, they are to never to meet with Lir-Tan.  \nJa-Rein will tell the PC’s that Lir-Tan \nprobably has agents looking for Lu-Merge, \nand they will not react kindly to any \n“competition”. \n Ja-Rein thinks of the party quite \nlowly, but if any of the party wants to \nbargain for more money, they must \nsucceed in a Diplomacy Check DC 20 to \ngain an increase of 50%, and earns Ja-\nRein’s grudging respect (he respects \nsomeone who wants to bargain for their \npay).  If the party wants half up-front, Ja-\nRein is more agreeable to that request, but \nmakes a threat about the party visiting the \ndungeons if they fail to produce results \nand if the noble finds out they’ve spent the \nmoney on women and booze. \n The PC’s can ask Ja-Rein some \nquestions relating to the disappearance, \nbut if they ask him about other matters, Ja-\nRein will grow impatient.  Here are some \nof the questions the PC’s may ask Ja-Rein \nregarding the disappearance. \n \n\n• When was your son last seen? Three \ndays ago in the morning after breakfast.  \nI scolded him for not paying too much \nattention to this studies and he stormed \nout of the hall like a spoiled brat. None \nof the servants saw him leave. \n\n10 \n\n\n\nThe Curse of Menstaugher Manor \n\n• Who is Lu-Merge?  Lu-Merge is the \nyoungest bastard son of a rival of mine, \nLir-Tan, a noble who is an arms dealer \nto various nobles and private armies of \nthe lands.  You shall have no dealings \nwith that noble under any \ncircumstances.  Both he and his sons are \ndouble-crossing cut throats that hide \nbehind the guise of civility. \n\n• Where do you think your son went? \nMy older sons, when they became old \nenough to learn the proper use of a \nsword and found themselves attracted \nto women, did what all the young \nnobles do, they disguise themselves as \nfreemen and go “slumming”, which \nmeans they head to the seedier parts of \ntown to drink, gamble, and pursue other \nhedonistic pursuits.  My son may have \ngone to Humantown.  If you go there, \nyou will find very little friends of any \ngiant in that slum and you weapons \nbetter be unbonded. \n\n• Does your son have any other \ninterests or hobbies that don’t \ninvolve “slumming”? Yes. My son is \nquite enamored with swordmaking, \nwhich is a commoner skill for the lower \nclasses, but there is a master craftsman, \na runechild, by the name Shilvirra, who \nthe lad is quite taken with and \nsometimes I have found him there when \nhe shouldn’t be.  I would check there as \nwell and ask her. \n\n• Does your son have anyone who he \nis courting? Well, officially, my son is \ntoo young to be courting anyone, but \nthat isn’t stopping him.  A young lass \nwho is the daughter of a prominent \ngiant has caught my son’s attention \nfrom time to time, but I wouldn’t waste \nmy time with her.  I’ve already covered \nthat angle, and he hasn’t been there in \nthe last four days.  \n\nWhen the PC’s leave the manor, Blue \nSergeant Ferros meets them and gives \n\nthem their weapons and passes.  Ferros \ntells the PC’s that the passes are good for \nonly three nights. \n\n \nIf the PC’s Refuse \n \n High Captain Jeressin will look at \nthe PC’s with a warning look and tell them \nthey should “reconsider” and that this is \nan opportunity to have a patronage for \nfurther employment opportunities. \n If the PC’s still refuse, Ja-Rein will \nstorm out of the study and Jeressin will tell \nthe PC’s that they should come with him \nso they can reclaim their weapons and any \nother belongings that might have been \ntaken by the Watch. \n As the PC’s exit the manor, they will \nfind themselves placed under arrest and \nput in shackles under the charge of \nRefusing a Noble-born (a minor crime that \ncarries a penalty of 50 gp and a night in the \nDungeon).  The PC’s can forfeit equipment \nto pay the fine, but must still stay the night \nin the Dungeon.  As the PC’s are being \ntaken back to the Watch Barracks, Jeressin \nwill ask them one more time, and this time \nwill offer them each an additional 100 gp \nupon completion, but if the PC’s refuse \nagain, Jeressin will be angry and charge \nthem with another crime of Refusing an \nOfficer of the Peace (another minor crime \nbut with two minor crimes against the \nPC’s, they will have to pay the fines [50 gp \neach], spend two days in the Dungeon, and \nthen be taken outside the city where they \nare not allowed to return to the city for a \nmonth. \n  \nThe Investigation \n \n\nThe PC’s will likely check out the \nboys’ friends and will find no new \ninformation other than they haven’t been \nseen in the last four days and that “those \n\n11 \n\n\n\nThe Curse of Menstaugher Manor \n\ntwo are more than likely slumming”.  If the \nPC’s aren’t discreet in their questioning \nwith the children of some of the nobility \nthat live in this talon, they will draw the \nsuspicion of the parents, nannies, and \nservants, who may order the PC’s to \nimmediately leave or call the Watch. \n If any of the PC’s are threatening or \nif their appearances are threatening, they \nwill not be walking far in the Noble Talon \nbefore they are stopped by a troop of \nWatchmen (10+1d10 Sibbecai 1st level \nwarriors led by a Red Sergeant that is \ntypically a 3rd level Sibbecai/3rd level \nwarrior). Even with talon passes, \ncomplaints of harassment will have the \nPC’s escorted out of the talon and not \nallowed to return. \n The second lead would be to locate \nShilvarra and question her.  Ja-Rein will \ntell the PC’s that Shilvarra works in \nSmokestack Village, the talon where all the \nmetal works are done.  If the PC’s go to the \nward, they will not have a hard time \nfinding her place and will find her at work \nwith many apprentices bustling about.  \nShilvarra is very friendly and outgoing \nunless the PC’s are threatening or rude and \nwill answer any questions regarding \nyoung Ka-Bailud; however she doesn’t \nknow much other than she hadn’t seen him \nin over a week, but she knows that Ka-\nBailud and Lu-Merge were talking about \ngoing to “the Old House”.  The Old House \nshould be a clue the PC’s can use to later \ninvestigate. \n  \nScene 3: Welcome to Humantown Scum! \n(EL 1) \n \n\nThe last lead would be to go to \nHumantown where they hear that all the \nyoung nobles go “slumming” and see if \nthey might find them there and ask \naround.  If the PC’s are being upfront with \n\nstrangers they meet and ask a lot of \nquestions in that talon, there is a 30% \nchance plus a cumulative 5% for each hour \nthey  are direct that will draw the attention \nof some thugs who will pose as \n“information brokers” and will only offer \nthe PC’s the information they need but \nonly if they are somewhere private “to be \naway from pryin’ eyes”.  These thugs will \nlead the PC’s to a nearby alleyway and \nattempt to rob them. \n\n \n2 Thugs (male humans 1st level \n\nwarrior, hp 6,7) \n  \n For PC’s who are being discreet and \npaying gold to keep mouths shut, a Gather \nInformation Check DC 15 (along with at \nleast a 1 gp offering) is needed for them to \nfind someone who knows of the lads the \nPCs speak of.  Gathering information in \nthis talon is somewhat time-consuming \nand it will take a full 1d4 hours before they \nget any kind of good information.  For \neach 1 gp the PC’s offer to the roll, give a \n+2 circumstance bonus to the roll (the sky \nis the limit on the amount of wealth they \nwant to part with).  Consult the table \nbelow for the result (the DM should roll \nsecretly).  The PC’s can continue to Gather \nInformation (they will have to spend gold \nagain to get the bonuses) if they aren’t \nsatisfied or want to continue to investigate \nin Humantown. \n \nGather Information Table \nDC Result \n15 “Yeah—hiccup! I know those guys! \n\nThey robbed me after a card game. \nThey hang out at the Weeping Lady \nTavern on Dead Dung Lane.  You \ngonna gut those skullwaggers?” \n(True.  Lu-Merge and Ka-Bailud did \nrob this drunk after a card game \nand they do hang out at the tavern, \n\n12 \n\n\n\nThe Curse of Menstaugher Manor \n\nbut haven’t been there in some \ntime.) \n\n20 “You want those guys?  I think they \nis those giant folk.  Y’know them \ngiant folk ain’t welcomed around \nhere in Humantown, don’t \nparticularly like them.  Y’know you \nain’t the first to be asking me about \nthem.  Some o’ the boys from the \nReaver Gang been askin’ ‘bout them \ntoo.  Last I heard, they took off and \nleft the talon like they were chasin’ \ndown a flying bag of gold kings!” \n(True. The Reaver Gang has been \nlooking for them and spotted the \nboys leaving the talon). \n\n25 “I know who yer talkin’ ‘bout \nfriend.  They ain’t no humans either, \nthose are them young giant nobles \ncomin’ down here to have some fun.  \nI tells ya that one of them is Lu-\nMerge, and a devil take him, that \none. Up to no good on those two.  I \nheard they braggin’ on takin’ on the \nOld House up in da Quarter \n(Freeman’s Quarter).” (True. The \nperson does know the two boys and \nhas heard them bragging about \ngoing to Menstaugher Manor (called \nthe “Old House”). If the PC’s press \nfor what the Old House is, the \nperson will shout something about \nhim not giving up his soul to talk \nabout such evil things and will warn \nthe PC’s to avoid the topic.  The \ninformant will flee when possible. \n\n30 “Oh, you’re in for some trouble cuz \nnot only is the Reaver Gang askin’ \n‘bout them giant kids, but there’s \nthis catman (slur for Litorian) who \nbeen followin’ and askin’ questions \ntoo.  I tell ya, I see murder in them \neyes and they scares me something \npowerful.  That catman ain’t natural \nand I think it a demon collectin’ its \n\ndue off of those no-gooders.  Well, I \ndon’ think it a matter anyways. \nThose boys want to take on Lucius’ \nHouse themselves and I’s tell ya \nthat no one goes in that accursed \nplace and lives to tell about it.” \n(True and False. While the \ninformant knows of the two boys  \nand their intentions to go to \nMenstaugher Manor, he is wrong \nabout his perception about Merkan \n(but not so wrong about the \nReavers). If the PC’s ask the \ninformant about where Lucius’ \nHouse is, he tells them that’s a really \nbad idea, but if they’re determined \nto go, it’s up in the Freeman’s \nQuarter and is the largest house in \nthat talon that is all boarded up.  It \nwill be easy to find. \n\n \nWrapping Up the Investigation \n \n If the PC’s follow up on the “Old \nHouse” lead, but didn’t meet the informant \nto meet the DC 30 for the Gather \nInformation Check, it will take another \nGather Information Check of DC 15 to find \nout enough information on the Old House \n(Menstaugher Manor) that will lead the \nPC’s to Freeman’s Quarter.   \n Any magical divination that \nprovides definite or riddling answers to \nquestions will be able to lead the PC’s to \nMenstaugher Manor (albeit cryptically). \n \nScene 3: You’re Being Watched My Friend \n(EL 0 or EL 1) \n  \nSet-up—This can be either a role-playing \nencounter or a combat encounter \ndepending upon preference.  While the \nPC’s are investigating and asking \nquestions, it begins to rain hard again \n(reducing visibility to 60 ft) and making \n\n13 \n\n\n\nThe Curse of Menstaugher Manor \n\nthe efforts of the PC’s traveling about in \nthe talon less than pleasant.  As they go \nthrough the labyrinth alleys of \nHumantown, have each of them make a \nSpot Check.  A litorian, Vargrish, is a \nReaver Gang member who serves as the \ngang’s lookout when out on their jobs of \nmugging people.  Currently, Vargrish is \nwearing a dark cloak and is hiding from \nthe PC’s.   \n\nIf this is a role-playing encounter, \nroll a Hide Check with a +2 modifier and \nany PC’s who makes it spots Vargrish.  \nVargrish will immediately disappear in a \nnearby alleyway and be gone before the \nPC’s react, but may give the impression to \nthe party that this maybe the litorian that is \nasking the questions about the two noble \nlads.  This could complicate things when \nthe party actually meets Merkan. \n If this is a combat encounter, \nVargrish will assess the party’s ability to \nfight and will fire off his light crossbow at \nany spellcaster types (the ones wearing no \narmor usually is a good clue for him).  \nFighting in heavy rain forces everyone to \nmove 10 ft less than their current \nmovement, suffer a -3 penalty to all ranged \nattack rolls, skill checks, and saves.  In \nmelee combat, the rain provides a 20% \nconcealment chance that an attack will \nmiss to anyone standing in the rain. \nAnyone who is under a roof or awning \nloses their concealment.   \n \n Vargrish (hp 14) See Monsters and \n\nNPC’s for stats \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \nMenstaugher Manor \n \n\nWhen the PC’s find the “Old \nHouse”, they see it rest on a small hillock \nthat clearly dwarfs the other surrounding \nbuildings.  All the doors are standard \nwooden doors (5 hardness, 15 hp, Break \nDC 18) and are unlocked unless \nspecifically stated otherwise.  The ceiling \nheight in the rooms is 15 ft unless \nspecifically stated otherwise. \n \n1st Floor \n \n1. Gate \n \n You’ve arrived at Menstaugher \nManor.  It is a grand house by the \nstandards you see here in the Freeman’s \nQuarter with the large L-shaped manor \nsitting atop a small hillock with a tower on \nthe east end.  The manor looks to be in \ngood condition with bright red brick lining \nalong the outside of the walls except the \ntower.  The tower is made of standard \nmason blocks of chiseled stone and is \ncompletely covered with vines running up \nthe entire sides of the tower all the way to \nits roof. \n The front entrance has a large brass-\nplated sign written in Common reading, \n“Menstaugher Manor”.  A double gate \nblocks your way, but where there use to be \na chain and lock has been sawed through \nand the chain lies on the ground broken.  \nThrough the gates, you can clearly see an \novergrown front lawn of the manor that \nhas a cobblestone path leading up to the \nfront steps.  All the windows of the manor \nare completely boarded up and you can \ntell that the doors were boarded up, but \nsomeone has clearly pulled out the boards \nand apparently went in through the main \nentrance. \n\n14 \n\n\n\nThe Curse of Menstaugher Manor \n\n \n Anyone who can track can see that \nwith a Wilderness Lore Check DC 5, two \npairs of boot tracks can be seen walking up \nto the steps of the main entrance.  \n \n2. Barn and Stables \n \n The PC’s will find an empty barn, \nbut a Search Check DC 15 will find brown \nstains along the horse stalls (Lucius \nmurdered the horses in their stalls when he \nfinished killing the servants and pulled \ntheir remains in the house). \n \n3. Main Entrance \n \n You can clearly tell someone has \npried the nails out of the boards covering \nthe main doors, but they are both exposed \nnow and the boards lie broken on the \nsteps.   \n One of the doors is opened and \ndarkness greets you beyond.  A flash of \nlightning shutters out of the bleak sky and \nyou get a glimpse of a foyer within. \n \n4. Foyer (EL 1) \n \n Opening before you is a large \nchamber lined with crossed swords \nhanging on plastered stone walls that \ndecorate this room.  There are some \ncouches that are turned over and one has \nbeen recently ripped apart.   \n \n That’s not all in the foyer.  Behind \nthe ripped couch are a pack of dire rats \ncurrently waiting for the PC’s to come \ncloser.  They haven’t eaten in quite awhile \nand are much braver than normally, but if \nthey are hit and still alive, they will flee \nwhenever possible \n \n 4 Dire Rats (hp 3, 4, 5, 5) \n\n \n5. Trophy Chamber (EL 1) \n  \n The PC’s see various trophies of \nanimals mounted on the wall when Lucius’ \nused to hunt wild game in far away lands.  \nHe hung them in this chamber as a display \nof fighting prowess. \n A single dire rat is in this chamber \nscavenging for its next meal \n \n Dire Rat (hp 5) \n  \n If the PC’s search this chamber, they \nwill find a secret compartment behind one \nof the trophies (Search Check DC 16). \nInside the compartment is a small key as if \nit would fit a trinket box or a wardrobe \ncloset.  This key is important for the \nmagical wardrobe in Area 33. \n \n \n6. Parlor Room \n \n You enter a long chamber with no \nother apparent exits and a boarded up \nwindow by the east wall.  This looks to be \na parlor room for a noble to entertain \nguests while they played cards or dice.  \nThe room looks relatively undisturbed. \n \n The PC’s that search this room will \nfind several decks of playing cards stashed \naway on the shelves. \n \n7. Menstaugher’s Study and Office (EL 1) \n \nSet-up—the door to this room is locked \n(the key is lying somewhere on the floor in \nArea 33).  Lucius also reinforced the door \n(hardness 5, hp 30, Break DC 25, because \nhe didn’t want thieves breaking in his \nstudy.  When the City Watch came and \narrested Lucius, they didn’t want to have \nanything to do with searching the house \n\n15 \n\n\n\nThe Curse of Menstaugher Manor \n\nand left because of the curse of the pirates’ \ntreasure that Lucius brought back with \nhim.  There is still the body of Lucius’ \nbutler (one of his first victims out of his \nhousehold) lying underneath the desk.  \nUnfortunately, the lack of a proper burial \nand the evil within the house has caused \nthe body to stir once again that will attack \nany living thing entering the room \n \n With the door finally opened you \nfind yourself in a large semi-octagonal \nroom that has a high arched ceiling \nconsists a beautiful mural of angels smiting \nthe forces of darkness.  Between boarded \nup barred windows are shelves filled with \nvarious knick-knacks and books.  A large \ncherry wood desk that spans about 10 ft \nacross and 5 ft wide stands in the center of \nthe chamber and a plush leather chair rests \nabout a few feet away from the desk.  \nCovering the floor is a faded carpet that is \nstill plush to the touch. \n The smell of an old rot is pervading \nin the chamber and before you can \ninvestigate the desk lurches and begins to \nmove on its own. Suddenly the desk lifts \noff one side and tumbles sideways \ncrashing into a window immediately \nrevealing the cause of the disturbance.  \nTurning slowly around to face you is a \nrotting figure with grey flesh and clothes \nthat only a servant of a noble would wear.  \nWith eyes of hate, it begins to stumble \ntoward you. \n  \n 1 Zombie (hp 16) \n  \n If the PC’s search the room, they \nwill nothing out of the ordinary other than \nthey can tell that a painting on one of the \nwalls is missing (Search DC 15). \n \nTreasure: If the PC’s set the desk back \ndown, they can search the drawers and \n\nfind 25 sp inside a small bag.  The books \nare but ledgers for his various financial \nenterprises he funded up until he returned \nfrom the pirates’ defeat and contain no \ninherent value.  The knick-knacks and \ntrinkets carry a total value 1 gp (10 lbs \nworth of stuff).  The curtains and carpet \nare too ruined to be worth anything. \n \n8. Dining Hall \n \n A dining table for twelve guests is \nin the middle of the room. \n \n9. Stairway to Second Level \n \n This stairway goes up to Area 22. \n \n10. Privy \n \n Privy. \n \n11. Kitchen and Servant’s Entrance \n  \n This is a standard kitchen with an \noven, pots, pans, and cooking ware.  The \nparty will have to batter down the boards \nbarring the rear entrance door if they want \nto leave this way. \n \n12. Backyard \n \n An overgrown backyard that hasn’t \nseen a caretaker in ages sprawls before \nyou.  Small statues of artful decoration of \nvarious races in artistic poses are chipped, \nworn, and some of them lie in pieces \nthroughout the yard.  A well can be seen in \nthe northeast corner. \n \n13. Well \n \n This well runs about 40 feet down \ninto the ground and there is a pool of \nwater below.  Lucius used to hire \n\n16 \n\n\n\nThe Curse of Menstaugher Manor \n\nspellcasters to purify the water from \ncontaminants.  Since no one has tended the \nwell, the water can cause disease (from it’s \nclose proximity to the sewers).  Anyone \nwho drinks the rank water must make a \nFort Save DC 18 or lose 1d4 Con.  Any \nspell that removes disease and similar \nafflictions will cure this disease.   \nTreasure: If the party searches on the \ninside of the well about 10 ft down, there is \na secret compartment (Search DC 16).  \nInside the compartment are two gems \n(each worth 50 gp) and a small key.  This \nkey is important to open the wardrobe in \nArea 33. \n \n14. Kitchen Storage and Supplies \n \n Extra supplies, dry goods, and \ncooking utensils are placed here. \n \n15. Maid’s Bedroom (EL 1) \n  \n The smell of an old rot is strong in \nthis room and before you is a servant’s \nbedroom by the simple furnishings—a bed \nand a dresser drawer.  The fate of the \nservant who lived in this room is apparent \nas there are dark stains of splatter \neverywhere along the walls and bed \nsheets.  It seemed the City Watch cared \nnothing for removing the victim as a \nskeleton clearly lies sprawled across the \nbed missing its head. \n  \n This is Lucius’ maid who was \nbrutally murdered by him when he came \nback.  He left her body in her bedchamber \nand had taken the head elsewhere.  When \nthe City Watch came, they left the blighted \nmanor as quickly as they came, having \nnothing to do with the bodies, grisly \nmurders, and most of all—the curse of \nLucius and his stolen pirates’ treasure.   \n\n Unfortunately, not receiving a \nproper burial and with Lucius’ presence in \nthe manor, the skeleton will animate and \nattack the nearest PC that comes within 5 \nft. of it. \n \n\nSkeleton, advanced (+2 HD, +13 \nhp, extra +1 attack [claw], extra +1 \nto Fort, Ref, and Will) \n\n \nTreasure:  Underneath the maid’s bed, is a \nsmall coffer that seems as if it was tossed \nunder there.  The coffer is locked (Open \nLock DC 20), but inside was the maid’s \nsavings of 45 cp, 3 sp, and 1 gp. \n \n16. Stairwell \n \n This stairwell descends down into \nthe basement to Area 35. \n \n17. Butler’s Bedroom \n \n This room is similar to the maid’s \nbedroom of the vicious display of violence \nhere 20 years ago.  There is no body and \nthe room is in disarray. \n  \n18. Minor Guest Bedroom \n \n Artisans and expert craftsman who \nhad traveled from afar to produce art or to \nwork a masterwork crafts for Lucius’ were \noften allowed to stay at the manor while \nthey worked on their projects.  They would \nstay here.  The room is filled with dust as \nno one has used it in a long time. \n \n19. Cook’s Bedroom (EL 1) \n \n The door to this room is locked \n(Open Lock DC 15), but if the party is not \nquiet, the zombie (the former cook) will \nhear them and begin to pound on the door.  \n\n17 \n\n\n\nThe Curse of Menstaugher Manor \n\nIt will attack the nearest PC if the door gets \nopen or destroyed. \n \n\nZombie, advanced (+2 HD, 29 hp \ntotal, extra +1 to attack, extra +1 to \nFort, Ref, and Wil saves) \n\n \n Searching the bloodstained room \nreveals nothing. \n \n \n \n \n20. Inside Garden (EL 2) \n \n This 20 x 15 chamber is actually an \nopen area that was supposed to have an \ninside garden.  The windows are boarded \nup and a cobblestone walkway runs along \nthe west wall to a door.  The floor is filled \nwith dirt for flowers and plants to grow, \nand there is a small path marked by stones \nlaid into the dirt.  The garden is long dead \nas the plants withered away to dried \nhusks. \n \n Buried under the dirt are two bodies \nthat Lucius had murdered.  If any \ncharacter comes with 5 ft of the east wall. \nThe zombies will rise from the ground and \nattack. \n \n\n2 Zombies, advanced (+2 HD, 29 hp \ntotal, extra +1 attack, extra +1 Fort, \nRef, and Will saves) \n\n \nTreasure: One of the zombies has a \nnecklace about its neck that is made of \ngold (worth 20 gp).  Any PC fighting the \ncreature or searches it after it’s been \ndestroyed can easily spot the necklace. \n \n21. Exchequer’s Bedroom \n \n\n This room is similar to the other \nservant’s quarters in that there are signs of \na brutal murder that took place.  There is \nno body.  \n\nThis room contains a journal written by \nSoudin Guilder, Lucius’ exchequer.  The \njournal is easily found on a desk and the \npages are splattered with blood. Most of \nthe journal discusses Soudin’s interest in \nhis hobbies, gardening and pottery, but \nalso discusses various duties he has to \nperform while Lucius is away.  Most of the \njournal is quite boring given a servant who \nhas an easy life until the journal dates \nwhen Lucius had returned and gives the \ngist of the following information: \n \n\n• Lucius was a great employer to \nwork for. \n\n• He fought many battles against \npirates and even found their secret \nhiding places on an island called the \nIsland of Blood. \n\n• A single page written in common \nhas this note, “I know its one of the \ncells and it has to be word-activated, \nbut what?” (Soudin was trying to \nfigure out how to get into the Sealed \nVault, because he wanted to see \nfirst-hand the great treasures that \nLucius was reported to have, but to \nnever take). \n\n• Lucius came back completely \nchanged.  He was a cruel and harsh \nemployer and Soudin felt that \nsomehow his trip to the island had \nchanged him, though he doesn’t \nknow what caused it. \n\n• The last entry is Soudin writing \nfrantically as he is trapped in his \nroom.  He cannot flee because the \nservant’s windows were barred long \ntime ago and he can hear the \nscreams of Waylanna (the cook) \ndown the hall.  Soudin begs anyone \n\n18 \n\n\n\nThe Curse of Menstaugher Manor \n\nwho finds his journal to avenge his \nmurder and to hunt down Lucius. \n\nTreasure: Soudin hid away in his room in a \nhollow bed post his savings (Search DC 18 \nto find).  Inside the hollow post is a small \nsack containing a gem (worth 50 gp) and 3 \npp. \n \n2nd Floor \n \n22. Stairway to Level 1 \n \n This stairway descends to the first \nfloor to Area 9. \n \n23. Stairway to Level 3 \n \n This stairway leads to the third floor \nto Area 34.   \n \n24. Minor Guest Bedroom \n \n This room is another guest bedroom \nfor artisans and craftsman that Lucius \nhired from time to time. \n \n \n \n \n \n25. Trophy Room and Practice Chamber \n \n An impressive hall of swords, \ndaggers, and other blades of destruction \nline the walls of this chamber.  Banners of \nvarious tribes and nations decorate the \nspaces between the weapons and a large \ncarpet spreads along the north/south axis \nof the chamber that indicates this is a \nfencing arena.  \n \n This is where Lucius and some of \nthe local nobility would spar and train in \nbetween missions to deal with pirates and \ninsurgent kingdoms.   \n\n The swords represent standard \nequipment which he and his opponents \nwould train and the banners are some of \nhis trophies by those tribes or petty \nkingdoms that stood against him.  Anyone \nwith Knowledge (heraldry) can make a DC \n20 check to recognize these banners. \n \nTreasure: If the PC’s are interested in \nlooting the manor, then there are six short \nswords, six long swords, two falchions, \nand 20 daggers all along the wall.  The \nbanners aren’t worth anything. \n \n26. Storage Room \n \n This room was to store various \nlinens and similar items for Lucius and his \nguests. \n \n27. Guest Bedroom \n \n An opulent chamber of a furnished \nroom for a single guest stands before you.  \nA bed with a canopy is to the west wall, a \ndresser drawer and a wardrobe cabinet are \nin the east wall, and a water basin is in the \nsoutheast corner.  A small writing desk \nrests near the bed and a glass doorway in \nthe north wall would lead out to a balcony, \nbut is currently boarded up. \n \n Lucius who entertained nobility and \nhad them stay as guests were put up in his \nguest bedrooms.  Because of his fame and \nreputation, he held audiences almost daily \nwhen he was home and many nobles took \nwell to his hospitality.   This room was \nsituated for human-sized guests, but the \nceilings are tall (15 ft.), so if Lucius had to \nrefit the room to accommodate a giantish \nguest, he could do so. \n When Lucius returned from the Isle \nof the Blood Red Moon, he stopped having \nguests and became a recluse as The Book of \n\n19 \n\n\n\nThe Curse of Menstaugher Manor \n\nNex worked its tendrils of evil into his \nmind and soul. \n \nTreasure: If the PC’s want to loot each \nroom (and not manage to get arrested), all \nthe items in here (and other rooms) are \nworth a collective 100 gp on the market as \nmuch of it is moldy and somewhat ruined \nfrom lack of care; however, PC’s seen \nwalking out of Menstaugher Manor with \nfurniture will draw the ere of the City \nWatch and Captain Jeressin especially, so \nthey must be careful how they get the \nfurniture out. \n \n28. Guest Bedroom \n \n This room is a similar human-sized \nguest room for nobility. \n  \n29. Guest Bedroom for Giant Visitors \n \n This chamber is large enough for \ngiantish guests who visited Lucius.  The \nfurniture is built for someone of about 10 ft \nin height (and weighs twice as much).  \n \n30. Master Guest Bedroom \n \n This chamber was where Lucius put \nup guests who were important to him \nwhen he was attempting to curry favor or \ngain an alliance.  Lucius’ made his guests \nin this room feel especially welcomed. \n The room could easily \naccommodate any of the races (giantish or \nsmaller). \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n31. Meeting Room \n \n A small 10 ft square room with a \nsingle table and some chairs adorn this \nroom.  Various weathered maps of the City \nof Cat Watch, the surrounding regions, \nand navigational charts are on the table \nand tacked on the walls.  This seems some \nkind of planning room. \n \n Lucius used this room whenever he \nmet with a few nobles to do combat \nplanning, particularly during the pirate \nattacks.  The maps can be of various use to \nthe PC’s.  First, it will give the PC’s a +5 \ncircumstance bonus to any Knowledge \ncheck regarding a location in the City of \nCat Watch or the surrounding regions.   \nThis bonus cannot be used for any kind of \ngain (like to determine the best routes to \ncircumvent the City Watch while \nsmuggling or locations of secret places in \nthe City of Cat Watch, like a thieves guild). \nSecondly, the maps will provide the best \nsailing routes given navigation and \nwind/sea currents that will reduce any \nsailing along the coast by 1 day (to a \nminimum of 1 day).  Lastly, at the DM’s \noption, Lucius was a treasure map \ncollector and went on some treasure \nhunting expeditions early in his career.  \nThose treasure maps are here in this room \nin the corner. A couple of the treasure \nmaps will be marked as the treasure had \nbeen found, and a few others not marked.  \nIt is up to the DM to detail any treasure-\nhunting expeditions the PC’s may be \nwilling to undertake.  If all the maps are \nsold, they will fetch 100 gp in the entirety. \n \n32. Library \n \n Books line the shelves all the way to \nthe 15 ft ceiling.  A small writing table with \n\n20 \n\n\n\nThe Curse of Menstaugher Manor \n\na single chair stacked with books lies in the \ncenter of this room. \n \n The books are of various treatises \nand essays on literature, medicine, combat, \nsailing, and history.  The books as a whole \nfor each subject will grant a +1 Knowledge \ncheck as long as the characters have them \nfor reference.  A collector will buy the \nbooks (there are five hundred of them) for \n1 gp each (don’t forget about the City \nWatch!). \n \n33. Master Bedroom (EL 0, 3, or 4) \n \n A large bedroom ornately filled \nwith shelves, a table, desk, dresser \ndrawers, wardrobe cabinets, a wash basin, \nand a large canopy bed stands before you.  \n \n  If the PC’s search the room, they \nwill notice that one of the wardrobe \ncabinets is unusual (Search DC 18). The \nlock for the wardrobe cabinet has two \nholes for keys.  If the PC’s found the key in \nArea 5 (behind the trophy) and the key in \nArea 13 (down the well), both these keys \nare needed to unlock the magical secret \ncompartment within the wardrobe; \notherwise a standard Open Lock DC 20 \npicks the lock and inside will be clothing \nand boots.  If the PC’s have both of these \nkeys and turn them clockwise, the \nwardrobe will open to reveal the normal \nthings, but if the PC’s turn the key counter-\nclockwise then the PC’s will hear a loud \n“thunk” and opening the cabinet doors \nwill reveal a only a large book covered in \nblack scales.  This is the Book of Nex Volume \nI (see entry in New Magic Items).  Another \nSearch Check DC 10 will find the key that \nopens the lock door to Area 7. \n \nEnter the Reaver Gang \n \n\nIf the DM is running a more investigative \nadventure, this encounter is optional.  If \nnot, then the Reaver Gang will arrive \nshortly in the manor when the PC’s begin \nsearching the room.  Unless the PC’s are \nbeing extraordinarily quiet in their \nmovements and searching, the Reaver \nGang will quickly hear that there is \nsomeone upstairs thinking it’s the two \ngiant boys.  The Reaver Gang will not be \nquiet in their approach and will rush to the \nroom. A PC by the bedroom door can \nmake a Listen Check DC 5 to hear the \nReaver Gang exiting the practice room \n(Area 25) and heading toward the party.  \nThe party will have one full round before \nthe Reaver Gang arrives at the bedroom \ndoor.  If the PC’s have encountered \nVargrish, but he managed to get away, he \nwill be here in this fight; otherwise, use the \nsecond option. \n \n\nReaver Gang; Vargrish (hp 14) and \ntwo Reavers (hp 12, 13); see \nMonsters and NPC’s for stats \n \n\nOR \n \n\nThree Reaver Thugs (hp 11, 13, 14) \n \nEnter Lucius \n \nIf the DM decides not to run the Reaver \nGang encounter, then this encounter could \noccur.  Lucius is connected to certain \nrooms in his manor where he can sense life \n(thanks to the book). There is a one time \n20% chance that allow Lucius to detect the \nparty’s presence in his former master \nbedroom.  Should he sense the PC’s \npresence, he will arrive in the next round \nand attack.  If Lucius is injured, he will flee \nback to dungeons and draw strength from \none of the two boys trapped there to deal \nwith the PC’s later. \n\n21 \n\n\n\nThe Curse of Menstaugher Manor \n\n \nTreasure: If the PC’s search the room, \nunderneath the bed is one of Lucius’ coffer \nbox for salaries he used to pay out to his \nservants. The coffer box is locked (Open \nLock DC 20) and trapped. \n \nPoison Dart Trap: CR 1; mechanical, \nlocation trigger, manual reset; Atk +8 \nranged (1d4 plus poison, dart); poison \n(DC 12 Fort save resists, 0/1d4 Con plus \n1d3 Wis; Search DC 20; Disable Device \nDC 18 \n  \n\nInside the coffer box is 329 cp, 488 \nsp, 102 gp, and 3 pp.  There is also a potion \nof lesser battle healing (marked as such). \n \n33A. Master Bedroom Storage \n \n This storage chamber contains extra \nlinens and other items related to keeping \nLucius’ bedroom clean. If the PC’s are \nwilling to move boxes and crates around, a \nSearch Check DC 15 will find a large \npainting wrapped in paper.  If the PC’s \nunwrapped the painting, they see a \npainting of a beautiful human woman.  A \nsingle brass plaque reads in Common, \n“Calessa Menstaugher”.  Calessa \nMenstaugher was Lucius’ only wife who \ndied giving childbirth.  The child did not \nsurvive either and Lucius never married \nagain.  The pain of seeing his wife’s visage \nbore into him and he had  wrapped and \nstored the painting in here.  \n \n3rd Floor \n \n34. Dark Study (EL 1 or EL 4) \n \n The secret door to this room can be \nfound with a Search Check DC 21.  The \nsecret door is locked (the key is in Area 39).  \n \n\nEnter Lucius \n \n If the PC’s haven’t encountered \nLucius in the master bedroom (Area 33) \nthere is a one time 50% chance that Lucius \nwill become aware of someone in his dark \nstudy and attack. \n \n A large study is before you as you \nsee a large cherry wood desk with an \nornate chair behind it.  The scenes of \ncarnage and rot are evident in this room as \nthere must be at least 20-30 skeletons that \nyou can tell were cut down.  Dried red \nstains have ruined the lush carpet and \nwalls. \n Then with a cracking sound, one of \nthe skeletons move. \n \n Two skeletons will rise up and \nattack the PC’s. \n \n Skeletons (hp 5, 6) \n \n If the PC’s search the room, they \nwill find that most of the furniture that \nused to be in this room is missing as they \nsee spots against the walls and floor that \nindicated that something use to occupy \nthat space.  If any PC searches, they can \nfind a clue to the key in Area 13. A Search \nDC 16 will find an inscription carved into \nthe wall reading in Common, “IT’S IN \nTHE WELL.”  Lucius wrote this to \nremember his keys as his memory was \nslowly fading away from being tormented \nby the book. \nBasement \n \n35. Stairwell to Level 1 \n \n This stairwell ascends to the 1st floor \nto Area 16.  \n \n36. Trapped Secret Door \n\n22 \n\n\n\nThe Curse of Menstaugher Manor \n\n \n The secret door to the areas east of \nthe door is locked (Open Lock DC 20) and \ntrapped. \n \nPoison Dart Trap: CR 1; mechanical, \nlocation trigger, manual reset; Atk +8 \nranged (1d4 plus poison, dart); poison \n(DC 12 Fort save resists, 0/1d4 Con plus \n1d3 Wis; Search DC 20; Disable Device \nDC 18 \n \n37. Wine Cellar (EL 2) \n \n The 20 ft square room used to be a \nwine cellar but no more as the floor is \ncompletely covered with shattered glass \nand purplish stains of wine covers the \nentire floor.  Between the smashed bottles \nare the ruined racks that use to hold the \nwine, now in pieces across the floor.  You \nwonder what kind of thing would go on a \nrampage, but it seems your question is \nanswered for you as you hear the \nshambling of movement and glass \ncrunching under the weight of something. \n \n There are four zombies that will \nmake their way to attack the PC’s.   \n \n 4 Zombies (hp 16, 14, 15, 19) \n \n38. Armory \n \n A small chamber filled with \nweapons that haven’t seen better days \nlitter the floor of this room.  Too much \nmoisture crept into this room and many of \nthe weapons on the wood-rotted racks are \nrusted in many spots. \n \nTreasure: If the PC’s search the room, they \nwill find a silvered dagger and a \nmasterwork longsword. \n \n\n \n39. Torture Chamber (EL 5 and EL 2) \n \nNote: This can be a challenging encounter \neven for a 1st level party and if the party \nisn’t prepared to handle the encounter, this \nencounter can be too challenging. \n \n A 20 ft long, 10 ft wide chamber is \nbefore you that had blood-stained racks \nand various small tables with tools of \ntorture, covered in dried gore, laid on top.  \nThe room feels eerily cold and you can see \nyour breath in here.   \n \n\nThis chamber was originally a secret \nmeeting room that Lucius had set up with \nhis most trusted allies when having to deal \nwith the costly political intrigues in Cat \nWatch and couldn’t afford to be seen \nplanning.  Lucius did build a dungeon to \nhold secret prisoners who would he later \nbargain with to give them their freedom in \nexchange for information (it’s how he \nmanaged to learn of the secret pirates’ \nhaven).  \n\n \nLucius is here in this room if the \n\nPC’s haven’t encountered him or if they \nhave driven him off, he’ll be here along \nwith three zombies \n\n \nLucius, cursed shadow; see \nMonsters and NPC for stats \n \n3 Zombies (hp 16, 17, 17) \n\n \n The room has no treasure, but if the \nPC’s search the chamber (Search DC 16), \nthey will find a bloodied key in a stained \nmetal bowl on one of the tables.  This key \nopens the secret door in Area 34. \n \nEnter Merkan \n \n\n23 \n\n\n\nThe Curse of Menstaugher Manor \n\n If the DM hasn’t introduced Merkan \nyet, this is a good time.  Merkan will have \nactually noticed the battle going on \nbetween the party and the zombies hoping \nthe party will win but be severely \nweakened in the encounter. At no point \nwill he help unless it looks like the party \nwill lose the fight. \n Merkan will be dressed as a City \nWatchman and after the battle will \nintroduce himself stating that he is looking \nfor Lir-Tan’s son after hearing that the boy \nis missing.  Merkan may give clues to the \nPC’s that he is not what he seems, but will \ndo his best to bluff his way through.  \nClever PC’s may attempt to bluff Merkan’s \nignorance of Captain Jeressin and Sergeant \nFerros (Merkan does not know either men) \nand immediately catch him in a lie.  \nMerkan has no quarrel with the party and \nif he is found out lying, he will attempt to \nbluff them again stating that he was hired \nby Lir-Tan to get his son back. Merkan will \nstate that he doesn’t like direct methods of \ngetting his kid back and that his \n“employer” often uses ruses and trickery \nto get his way.  If the PC’s agree with \nMerkan, Merkan will tell the PC’s that if \nthey find the boys, Merkan will take Lir-\nTan’s son, Lu-Merge, to his father and the \nparty can take Ja-Rein’s son, Ka-Bailud \nback. \n If the PC’s still do not believe \nMerkan or seem hostile, Merkan may \nattack if the party is particularly weakened \n(if the party is severely weakened, he will \nattack for subdual damage—Merkan \ndoesn’t want to kill anybody he doesn’t \nhave to). \n If Merkan decides to flee, he may \nharass the PC’s along the way as they try \nto return either of the boys back to their \nfather (DM’s discretion). \n\n \n40. Dungeons (EL 1) \n\n \n The two giant noble boys, Ka-Bailud \nand Lu-Merge are trapped in one of the \ncells here too afraid and too weakened to \nleave because of Lucius.  Lucius, not \nreceiving visitors in so long, trapped the \nboys after they discovered the secret door \nin Area 36 and avoided the trap. The secret \ndoor to the dungeons was left open on \npurpose so Lucius would force the boys to \nrun down there and into one of the cells, \nwhich they did quite predictably.  The \nboys have been there since then, having \nfinished their food two days ago and \nfinished their drinking water today.  The \nshadow has attacked them, slowly \ndraining away bits of their sanity.  \nEventually, Lucius will grow tired of the \ngame (just when the boys are about to die) \nand turn them into cursed shadow spawn. \n \n40a. A cell with two decapitated skeletons. \n40b. Empty cell. \n40c. Empty cell, but in the back wall, there \nis a chalk message reading, “Behind the \ntrophy.” \n40d. Empty cell. \n40e. Lu-Merge and Ka-Bailud are here \nlocked away (Open Lock DC 22).  They are \nweakened and can barely move on their \nown.  If the PC’s provide healing and \nwater, they can recover their strength to \nwalk, but not do much else. \n40f. There is another skeleton here. \n40g. This cell has a zombie waiting to \nattack the first thing that opens the door. \n \n Zombie (hp 19) \n \n40h. This cell is empty but scrawled on the \nfloor in blood is a message reading, “The \nBook has taken us all!” \n \n41. Sealed Vault \n \n\n24 \n\n\n\nThe Curse of Menstaugher Manor \n\n A large metal door blocks the entry \ninto this room and is sealed.  The door \nitself is locked and trapped; however the \ndoor is a false door in that it will not open \nat all (it has no hinges and is set into the \nwall).  However, the true way into the \nroom is through the dungeon cell marked \n40h.  By stating a keyword that Lucius \nknew and anyone standing in the cell is \nteleported into the sealed vault.  The \nkeyword is “Calessa”.   \n \nPoison Dart Trap (in the lock): CR 1; \nmechanical, location trigger, manual \nreset; Atk +8 ranged (1d4 plus poison, \ndart); poison (DC 12 Fort save resists, \n0/1d4 Con plus 1d3 Wis; Search DC 20; \nDisable Device DC 18 \n \n A small room is before you with no \napparent exits.  Dust lays thick upon the \nfloor and upon the only table in the room, \nbut you can tell from the gleam of your \nlight that the table is covered with coins \nand other items. \n \nTreasure: The table is indeed covered with \ncoins and other treasure.  One the table is \n1,200 cp, 240 sp, 190 gp, 10 pp, two \nmasterwork daggers, 2 potions of lesser \nbattle healing (marked as such), a fine cut \nquartz worth 2 gp, an amethyst worth 20 \ngp, a piece of jade worth 50 gp, an agate \nworth 100 gp, and a 4 lb. block of gold \nworth 200 gp. \n \n To exit the room, the PC’s must \nspeak the word “Calessa” again to leave. \n  \n42. Escape Route \n \n Lucius always had a plan to escape \nquickly should he encounter a threat he \ncouldn’t handle.  The secret door along the \ndoor to the sealed vault can be found with \n\na Search DC 16.  The stairs along the \npassageway descend 15 ft to reach a sewer \ncorridor and the secret door can be found \nwith a Search DC 16.  \n \nConcluding the Adventure \n \nJa-Rein \n \n If the PC’s honor their bargain with \nJa-Rein and bring both the boys to him, he \nwill be quite pleased (though he will never \nshow it).  Captain Jeressin be on hand to \ntake the PC’s back to the Watch Barracks \nand give them their payment.  Captain \nJeressin will also give the PC’s a letter of \nintroduction to any of the mercenary, \nadventurer guilds, or colleges of magic \nsince by law in Cat Watch, one must \nbelong to a guild in order to be contracted \nto adventure within its lands.  The letter of \nintroduction will reduce the entry fees (up \nto the DM’s discretion as to how much \neach guild charges and the kind of \ndiscount the letter of introduction offers).  \n If the PC’s bring only Ja-Rein’s son, \nKa-Bailud, back to him, Ja-Rein will \nspecifically mention the agreement he had \nwith the PC’s to bring them both back.  Ja-\nRein will refuse to compensate the PC’s \nand orders Captain Jeressin to have them \nremoved from the property.  Captain \nJeressin will tell the PC’s that while Ja-Rein \ndidn’t get what he wanted, the PC’s did \nwhat was best and will give them any \nreward he promised them (if it came to \nthat) or offer them 100 gp each and a letter \nof introduction. \n \nLir-Tan \n \n If the PC’s bring Lu-Merge back to \nLir-Tan, he will graciously welcome the \nPC’s as heroes and offer them 100 gp each \nfor a reward.  Lir-Tan will write a letter of \n\n25 \n\n\n\nThe Curse of Menstaugher Manor \n\nintroduction for the PC’s to join a guild at \nno cost.  How the PC’s then approach the \nmatter with Ja-Rein could earn his ire. \n \nMerkan \n \n If the PC’s were convinced by \nMerkan to allow him to take Lu-Merge to \nhis father, they will discover they’ve been \ndeceived through either of two situations.  \nThey will discuss the assistance of the City \nWatch with Captain Jeressin who will deny \nthat there is no “Merkan” who works for \nthe City Watch (Captain Jeressin knows all \nthe City Watch personnel himself). If Ja-\nRein is present, he will find this very \namusing and point out that to the PC’s that \nit looks like Lu-Merge may remain missing \nfor a little more time or disappear entirely, \nthen begins to laugh about it. \n The second possibility is that the \nPC’s do not discuss the situation with \nCaptain Jeressin, but will be summoned to \nthe Watch Barracks after two days (if the \nPC’s are still in town). They will discover a \nfurious Captain Jeressin demanding to \nknow of what happened to Lu-Merge and \nthat the boy is still missing.  This could \nlead to another adventure where the PC’s \nhave to go out and find Merkan and \nconvince him to return the boy. \n Merkan will indeed barter with Lir-\nTan, holding his son hostage should he \nmanage to get away with Lu-Merge. Lir-\nTan will want to hire mercenaries to kill \nMerkan during an arranged meeting, but \nMerkan will be far more crafty and left to \nhis own devices will either kill Lu-Merge \nor Lir-Tan to satisfy his tribe’s honor. \n If the PC’s foiled Merkan’s plan, but \nhe manages to escape, the PC’s will have \nearned an enemy for the rest of their lives.  \nIf they kill Merkan, eventually someone \nfrom one of the two tribes that use to feud \nwill come looking for Merkan and will \n\nbegin investigating his death and \neventually catch up to the PC’s.  Whether \nthe litorians who do catch up will be in a \ntalking mood is up to the DM. \n \nThe Book of Nex Volume I \n \n If the PC’s were unfortunate to find \nthe book, they may be able to resist its \ncalling for a little while and find a way to \ndispose of the book.  The book cannot be \ndestroyed by conventional means and it \ncould be an adventure in of itself to find a \nway, but the simplest solution is that the \nPC’s hear of a burial ground not far from \nCat Watch where a group of greenbonds \ndispose of evil unnatural things by burying \nthem deep into consecrated ground.  The \nPC’s can easily take the book there and for \na donation of 100 gp, the greenbonds will \ntake the book off the party’s hands; \nhowever, about a month later, the PC’s will \nhear that the ground was violated and \nsomeone (or something) dug up the book \nand stole it, slaying a guarding oathsworn \nin the process.      \n \nThe Heart and Eyes Guild (The \nBodytakers) \n \n Defeating the unwitting thugs in \nthis guild’s plan to have the two boys \nkilled will have the party watched for now.  \nThe guild will be interested to see what \nweaknesses the characters will have and if \nany of them can be exploited.  Should the \ncharacters prove to be a thorn in the \nguild’s plans, they will start taking direct \nsteps to have the characters eliminated, but \nas of now, they will be watched.  From \ntime to time, a random PC while in the city \nwill notice that from a dark alleyway, \nsomeone watches her. \n \nPossible Continuations for the DM \n\n26 \n\n\n\nThe Curse of Menstaugher Manor \n\n \n Should the DM want to continue the \nadventure, there are three additional plots \nthat can be of use. \n \nThe Bad Seed: Shortly thereafter the \nadventure concludes, they will hear of a \nnewcomer in the city that claims to be the \nonly daughter of Lucius Menstaugher.  \nApparently, Lucius fathered a child during \nthe trying times of the piracy and when it \nwas found out that he was the \npsychopathic madman responsible for the \nmurders, the mother of Vera Menstaugher \n(Lucius’ daughter) fled the city and went \nfar away. On the mother’s deathbed when \nVera was 15, she told her the truth about \nher heritage and what her father had \nbecome.  Vera herself went out in the \nworld and did good wherever she went, \nbut made her way here to claim her \nbirthright. The City will magically \ninvestigate Vera’s claim, but it will stand \ntrue, and therefore give her the estate.  If \nthe PC’s did not find The Book of Nex \nVolume I, Vera will. Then the murders will \nbegin again.  It will only become a matter \nof time before the PC’s realize that the \ncurse that afflicted Lucius now has his \ndaughter and must put an end to another \ntragic tale.  The DM should use this \ncontinuation only if the PC’s failed to find \nthe book.   \n \nRedemption: So the book has taken root in \nthe heart and mind of one of the PC’s has \nit?  An angel by the name of Kirdon seeks \nout the book, but there is another party \nthat is also interested as well.  The PC’s \nand their afflicted comrade find \nthemselves in a game of cat and mouse \nwith an angel on one side and a devil on \nanother, while the possibility of breaking \nfree of this curse is rapidly dwindling. \n \n\nThe Enemy Within: If the PC’s have \npleased Ja-Rein with their performance \n(though he’d never let them know that), Ja-\nRein will hire them to investigate his \nexchequer, a human servant called \nHerondua.  Ja-Rein believes that Herondua \nis pilfering money and small valuables \nfrom the estate, but doesn’t know that \nHerondua is actually an agent for Lir-Tan \n(and who is greedy).  As soon as Ja-Rein \nfinds out about this, the PC’s are going to \nbe in the middle of a political intrigue \nwhere the stakes are a lot higher where the \ntwo nobles are going to send their agents \nto settle things once and for all. \n\n27 \n\n\n\nThe Curse of Menstaugher Manor \n\nMonsters and NPC’s \n \nBlue Sergeant Ferros Mordikai Medium \nHumanoid (Sibbecai) racial level \n3/Unfettered 10; HD 3d8+6 plus 10d8+30; \nhp 100; Hero Points 4; Dying/Dead -3/-16; \nInit +4; Speed 30 ft; AC 24 (touch 18, \nflatfooted 20); Attacks +18/+13/+8 (+2 \nkeen greater battle claw 1d8+4/17-20 x2) and \n+16/+11 (masterwork battle claw \n1d6+2/19-20 x2), or +14/+9/+4 (+2 keen \ngreater battle claw 1d8+4/17-20 x2) and \n+12/+7 (masterwork battle claw 1d6+2/19-\n20 x2) and +11 melee (bite 1d6+2), or +15 \nmelee (sap 1d6+1 subdual), or  +15 (dagger \n1d4+1/19-20 x2), or +17 ranged (light \ncrossbow 1d8); Size: 5 ft/5 ft; Fort +9, Ref \n+14, Will +5; Str 16, Dex 18, Con 16, Int 11, \nWis 9, Cha 10; Skills and Feats: Gather \nInformation +15*, Handle Animal +5*, \nInnuendo +14*, Sneak +18*, Tumble +13; \nAmbidexterity, First Strike, Improved \nTwo-Weapon Fighting, Iron Will, Modify \nCombat Style, Rapid Strike, Sense the \nUnseen, Two-Weapon Fighting, Weapon \nFocus (greater battle claw) \n*+2 racial bonus figured in \nRacial Abilities: Bite feat, Low-light vision, \nScent \nUnfettered Abilities: Evasion, Parry, Parry \nRanged Attacks, Sneak Attack +2d6 \nGear: +2 keen greater battle claw, \nmasterwork battle claw, +2 leather coat, \nbadge and cloak of rank, whistle, sap, light \ncrossbow with 40 bolts, 2 pairs of \nmasterwork manacles, 50 ft silk rope, and a \npouch containing 20 gp and 4 pp. \nMotivation: Blue Sergeant Ferros Mordikai \nis second in command in the City Militia.  \nHis dedication, honor among his fellow \nsibbecai, and his unwavering courage, has \nmade him the greatest choice for Captain \nJeressin, and should the High Watch \nCaptain retire or be killed, it is highly \nlikely that Ferros will succeed, but he only \n\nlooks at obtaining the position as a great \nhonor, not an ambition.  Ferros works hard \nat keeping the peace and making the city \nas great as it can be.  He is a little \ncontemptuous of the human watchmen as \nhe has the most discipline problems and \nconsiders them mostly unreliable.  When \nFerros goes out on patrol, he typically \ntakes a contingent made up of only \nsibbecai watchmen. \nCity Watchman, Human Medium \nHumanoid (Human) Warrior 1; CR ½; HD \n1d8+1; hp 5; Dying/Dead -1/-13; Init +0; \nSpeed 20 ft; AC 17/18 vs. swords  (touch \n11, flatfooted 16); Attacks +3 (longsword \n1d8+2/19-20 x2), or +2 melee (sap 1d6+1 \nsubdual), or  +2 (dagger 1d4+1/19-20 x2), \nor +2 ranged (light crossbow 1d8),  ; Size: 5 \nft/5 ft; Fort +2, Ref +0, Will -1 Str 13, Dex \n12, Con 13, Int 9, Wis 9, Cha 10; Skills and \nFeats: Climb +5, Intimidate +3; Natural \nSwordsman, Power Attack, Weapon Focus \n(longsword) \nGear: longsword, dagger, sap, beastscale \narmor, long shield, manacles, 50 ft rope, \nbadge and cloak of rank, whistle, 10 ft pole \nwith lantern on end (night watchmen \nonly), pouch with 2d10 sp  \nMotivation: A typical human city \nwatchman of Cat Watch is only partially \ninterested in keeping the peace, oftentimes \nthey like to harass newcomers, demand \nbribes, and gamble.  When a watchman \nhas to deal with an unruly situation, they \ntypically use their saps unless confronted \nwith someone brandishing weapons or a \nmore powerful foe. \n \nCity Watchman, Sibbecai Medium \nHumanoid (Sibbecai) Warrior 1; CR ½; HD \n1d8+2; hp 6; Dying/Dead -2/-15; Init +1; \nSpeed 20 ft; AC 18/19 vs. swords  (touch \n12, flatfooted 16); Attacks +3 (longsword \n1d8+2/19-20 x2), or +2 melee (sap 1d6+1 \nsubdual), or  +2 (dagger 1d4+1/19-20 x2), \n\n28 \n\n\n\nThe Curse of Menstaugher Manor \n\nor +3 ranged (light crossbow 1d8); Size: 5 \nft/5 ft; Fort +4, Ref +3, Will -1 Str 13, Dex \n14, Con 15, Int 7, Wis 9, Cha 10; Skills and \nFeats: Intimidate +4; Natural Swordsman, \nWeapon Focus (longsword) \nGear: longsword, dagger, sap, beastscale \narmor, long shield, manacles, 50 ft rope, \nbadge and cloak of rank, whistle, 10 ft pole \nwith lantern on end (night watchmen \nonly), pouch with 2d10 sp  \nMotivation: While not very intelligent, they \nare fiercely dedicated to their job.  They are \ntrained to know trouble when they see it, \nbut leave the technicalities and more \ncomplex problems to their sergeants and \ncommanders.  A sibbecai watchman’s \nprime motivation is to keep the peace. \n \nDire Rat Small Animal CR 1/3; HD \n1d8+1; hp 5; Dying/Dead -1/-12; Init +3; \nSpeed 40 ft; AC 15  (touch 14, flatfooted \n12); Attacks +4 melee (bite 1d4 plus \ndisease); Space/Reach: 5 ft/5 ft; SA disease \nFort +3, Ref +5, Will +3 Str 10, Dex 17, Con \n12, Int 1, Wis 12, Cha 14; Skills and Feats: \nClimb +11, Hide +8, Listen +4, Sneak +4, \nSpot +4; Alertness, Weapon Finesse \nDisease (Ex): Filth Fever—bite, Fortitude \nDC 11, incubation period 1d3 days, \ndamage 1d3 Dex and 1d3 Con.

Sometimes he \ncircumvents the law he swore to uphold to \nget around “legal obstacles” when \ninvestigating crimes involving high profile \npersons in the city. He believes in justice \nand is very trusting of the giant’s rule and \ntheir wisdom, but he feels that the city of \nCat Watch is suffering from a cancer that \nhe cannot stop.  Captain Jeressin is often \nembroiled in the political intrigues and he \nhas fewer friends than he has political \nallies (which could change at any \nmoment).  He would give his life for Blue \nSergeant Ferros as the sergeant would \ngladly lay down his life for Jeressin and the \ncity and the two trusts each other \nexplicitly. \n \n\n29 \n\n\n\nThe Curse of Menstaugher Manor \n\nJa-Rein Large Male Giant racial level \n3/Aristocrat 6; Large Giant; HD 3d10+12 \nplus 6d8+24; hp 75; Dying/Dead -4/-18; \nHero Points: 2; Init +0; Speed 30 ft; AC  \n(touch 10, flatfooted ); Attacks +10/+5 \n(masterwork greatsword 2d6+3/19-20 x2); \nSize: 5 ft/10 ft; Fort +9, Ref +5, Will +7; Str \n16, Dex 10, Con 18, Int 16, Wis12, Cha 12; \nSkills and Feats: Craft (bowmaking) +8*, \nDiplomacy +20*, Gather Information +9, \nIntimidate +13, Knowledge (ceremony) \n+15, Listen +7, Perform (storytelling) +4, \nSense Motive +15*, Spot +7; Born Leader, \nLightning Reflexes, Slippery Mind, Skill \nFocus (Diplomacy), Skill Application \n(Diplomacy and Gather Information)  \n*+2 racial bonus to these skills figured in. \nGear: Masterwork greatsword, 120 gp \n(typically when the PC’s encounter Ja-Rein, \nhe will not have much on him, but should \nhe leave his house, he will put on armor \nand various magical items for protection) \nMotivation: The family of Ja-Rein are \nmaster bowmakers and he runs the \nFletchers Guild as its Guildmaster. He \nbelieves it is only the natural order of \nthings for the giants to rule over all the \nraces as caretakers of the world.  The \nhumans greatly annoy him as upstart, \nresentful creatures that are unappreciative \nof what the giants have done for them.  Ja-\nRein uses his wealth and influence to keep \nthe status quo and to further his own goals \n(usually upstarting Lir-Tan, making \nmoney, and keeping humans in the place). \nJa-Rein sees Lir-Tan’s son missing as an \nexcellent opportunity to get his rival’s son \nfirst to be used as some kind of bargaining \nchip. \n \nKa-Bailud Medium Male Giant racial level \n1/Aristocrat 1; Medium Giant; HD 1d10+2 \nplus 1d8+2; hp 14 (2 when first \nencountered); Dying/Dead -2/-14; Init -1; \nSpeed 30 ft; AC 13  (touch 9, flatfooted 13); \n\nAttacks +4 (masterwork longsword \n1d8+3/19-20 x2), or  +3 (dagger 1d4+2/19-\n20 x2) ; Size: 5 ft/5 ft; Fort +2, Ref +1, Will \n+2 (currently -2) Str 14, Dex 8, Con 14, Int \n11, Wis 11 (currently 2), Cha 10; Skills and \nFeats: Craft (bowmaking) +6*, Diplomacy \n+3*, Gather Information +1, Intimidate +4, \nKnowledge (ceremony) +1, Sense Motive \n+3* (currently -1); Natural Swordsman, \nLightning Reflexes \n*+2 racial bonus to these skills figured in. \nGear: masterwork longsword, dagger, \nleather coat, long shield, empty waterskin, \nempty backpack, 16 gp \nMotivation: Ka-Bailud is 34 years old (the \nequivalent of a 14 year old human) and is \nthe son of Ja-Rein.  Ka-Bailud’s motivation \nis to seek adventure.  He is often bored \nwith his father’s political intrigues and is \nlike a lot of the other noble boys his age \nwho want to go “slumming”.  His best \nfriend is Lu-Merge, who he knows is the \nson of Lir-Tan, his father’s hated rival, so \nhe keeps his friendship a secret.  What Ka-\nBailud doesn’t know is that his father does \nindeed know about it.  Ka-Bailud will do \npretty much whatever Lu-Merge wants to \ndo from gambling and picking fights in \nhuman town.  He regards humans and \nsibeccai as underlings who should spend \nmore time obeying than talking. \n \nLir-Tan Large Male Giant racial level \n3/Aristocrat 4/Warrior 1; Large Giant; HD \n3d10+15 plus 4d8+20 plus 1d8+5; hp 76; \nDying/Dead -5/-20; Hero Points: 2; Init +0; \nSpeed 30 ft; AC 10  (touch 10, flatfooted \n10); Attacks +12/+7 (masterwork falchion \n2d4+4/18-20 x2); Size: 5 ft/10 ft; Fort +11, \nRef +2, Will +9; Str 20, Dex 10, Con 20, Int \n12, Wis 14, Cha 10; Skills and Feats: Climb \n+ 6, Craft (weaponsmithing) +9*, \nDiplomacy +15*, Gather Information +7, \nIntimidate +11, Jump +6, Knowledge \n(ceremony) +11, Listen +5, Ride +1, Sense \n\n30 \n\n\n\nThe Curse of Menstaugher Manor \n\nMotive +4*, Spot +4; Born Leader, Skill \nApplication (Spot and Listen), Skill Focus \n(Diplomacy), Iron Will \n*+2 racial bonus to these skills figured in. \nGear: Masterwork falchion, a ring of \nprotection +2, 200 gp (typically when the \nPC’s encounter Lir-Tan, he will not have \nmuch on him, but should he leave his \nhouse, he will put on armor and various \nmagical items for protection) \nMotivation: Lir-Tan is a patron of the \ndown-trodden humans who are resentful \nof the giant’s rule.  While has a friendly \ndemeanor, he has the vileness of a snake, \nand will make no hesitation to use any \nmeans of getting what he wants (while \nbeing pleasant about it).  Lir-Tan never \ngets angry or agitated, but harbors great \nhatred against Ja-Rein.  Lir-Tan is an arms \ndealer by trade and his family has a \ncouncil seat at the Mercenary Guild in Cat \nWatch.  Lir-Tan will do whatever it takes \nto climb to the top, his ambitions are to \nrule Cat Watch and subjugate the region \nunder his dominion.  He often secretly \nhires humans (mostly) to cause trouble and \nto use them as pawns in his games of \nintrigue. \n \n \n \nLucius Menstaugher Medium cursed \nshadow ; Medium Undead (Incorporeal); \nHD 6d12; hp 39; Init +5; Speed fly 50 ft \n(perfect); AC 12  (touch 12, flatfooted 11); \nAttacks +5 melee touch (1d6 Wis); Size: 5 \nft; Fort +2, Ref +3, Will +7; Str --, Dex 13, \nCon --, Int 8, Wis 15, Cha 14; Skills and \nFeats: Hide +5*, Listen +7, Search +4, Spot \n+5; Improved Initiative, Weapon Finesse \n(touch), Weapon Focus (touch) \n*In dark and shadowy areas add +8 to the \nhide check. \nMotivation: Lucius now serves as a slave of \nthe Book of Nex and prisoner to his manor.  \n\nHe enjoys tormenting Lu-Merge and Ka-\nBailud slowly to death. \n \nLu-Merge Medium Male Giant racial level \n1/Aristocrat 1; Medium Giant; HD 1d10+2 \nplus 1d8+2; hp 14 (3 when first \nencountered); Dying/Dead -2/-14; Init -1; \nSpeed 30 ft; AC 13  (touch 9, flatfooted 13); \nAttacks +4 (masterwork longsword \n1d8+3/19-20 x2), or  +3 (dagger 1d4+2/19-\n20 x2) ; Size: 5 ft/5 ft; Fort +2, Ref +1, Will \n+2 (currently -1) Str 14, Dex 8, Con 14, Int \n11, Wis 11 (currently 5), Cha 10; Skills and \nFeats: Craft (bowmaking) +6*, Diplomacy \n+3*, Gather Information +1, Intimidate +4, \nKnowledge (ceremony) +1, Sense Motive \n+3* (currently +0); Natural Swordsman, \nLightning Reflexes \n*+2 racial bonus to these skills figured in. \nGear: masterwork longsword, dagger, \nleather coat, long shield, empty waterskin, \nempty backpack, 7 gp \nMotivation: Lu-Merge is 35 years old (he is \nthe equivalent of a 14 year old human) is \ndefinitely the leader of the two and often \nfinds ways to get himself and Ka-Bailud in \na lot of trouble that they can’t handle.  Lu-\nMerge is as pleasant as his father and has a \nvicious nature as well, but often doesn’t \nshow it unless in Humantown, his favorite \nhaunt.

In life \nNex details his life in pursuit of many horrendous pleasures that can only be described as \ncrimes against all the races and his knowledge of demon summoning.  The books are magical \nand when together (there are nine volumes total) form a horrific artifact.  They also contain \nmany horrific secrets within. \n \nVolume I—The Beginning \n \nThis book will grant a +2 circumstantial bonus on any knowledge skill check only involving \nany matter relating to demons.  It details much of Nex’s early life and his dark pursuits.  \nReading this book causes a character to lose 1 point of Wisdom permanently, but can call \nupon the knowledge contained within.  It takes 72 hours to read and decipher the book’s \nmaddening script. \n \nMadness Feats \n  \nNote: These feats are powerful and for good reason—the cost involved to have the feat can \ndrive someone mad with the knowledge contained within the book or corrupt them on a \ncourse toward chaotic carnage and destruction.  DM’s who allow characters access to these \nfeats should make it clear the penalties involved and the inherent danger to the character’s \nsoul. \n \nKnow the Demon Within \nPrerequisites: Must have read the Book of Nex Volume I, 1st level character \nThis feat allows the character call upon a surge of horrendous strength once a day.  A \ncharacter who activates this feat gets a +4 enhancement bonus to strength for 3 rounds + their \nnew strength modifier however they suffer 1d3 points of temporary Wisdom damage as the \npower makes them more mad-like. \nSpecial: The character can call upon this power without having to take it as a feat, but after \ndoing so, the character must reread the book in its entirety to be able to relearn this horrific \nknowledge (and thus losing another point of Wisdom permanently). \n \nKnow Where the Blood Flows I \nPrerequisites: Must have read the Book of Nex Volume I, 3rd level character \nThis feat allows a spellcasting character to cannibalize their own blood to gain an extra spell \nfor one time.  Calling upon this feat allows the character to suffer 1d6 points of damage and \n1d3 temporary Wisdom damage but is able to cast any spell they know up to a 3rd level spell. \nThe damage cannot be healed normally and the wisdom damage will return at the normal \nrate of 1 point per day. \nSpecial: The character can call upon this power without having to take it as a feat, but after \ndoing so, the character must reread the book in its entirety to be able to relearn this horrific \nknowledge (and thus losing another point of Wisdom permanently). \n\n34 \n\n\n\nThe Curse of Menstaugher Manor \n\n \nDire Weapon of Blood \nPrerequisites: Must have read the Book of Nex Volume I, 4th level character \nThis feat allows the character to inflict 1d6 points of damage to herself by cutting herself with \na weapon that she wants to become a weapon of blood.  A weapon of blood becomes sharper, \nmore menacing, and does more damage.  Any slashing or piercing weapon (including \nnatural weapons) where the blood is applied has its base die increased to the next die (a \nweapon that does 1d8 points of damage now does 1d10) and the critical threat range is \ndoubled (a longsword now has a threat range of 17-20/x2).  The affected weapon will remain \nso until combat starts for 1 round + the character’s Constitution modifier (the one who gave \nthe blood).  This feat can only be performed once per day and also inflicts 1d3 temporary \nWisdom damage when activated. This feat takes a move-equivalent action to activate. \nSpecial: The character can call upon this power without having to take it as a feat, but after \ndoing so, the character must reread the book in its entirety to be able to relearn this horrific \nknowledge (and thus losing another point of Wisdom permanently). \n \nSide Effects: The book is somewhat intelligent in that it contains a sentience of raw hatred \nand vileness.  Any intelligent creature slowly becomes corrupted by the book’s inherent \nnature and if fully succumbed, the creature will be bent on spreading murder and \ndestruction wherever it goes.  For each day, the book is in the possession of an intelligent \ncreature (having more than an animal intelligence), the creature must make a Will save DC 10 \nplus a cumulative +1 DC per week of possession (the DM should roll secretly for these rolls).  \nIf the creature reads the book, the Will save becomes a DC 15 plus a cumulative +1 DC per \nday of possession.  If the possessing creature calls upon the madness feats, the Will save is \nDC 20 plus a cumulative +1 DC per day of possession. If the creature takes a madness feat, \nthe Will save becomes a DC 25 plus a cumulative +1 DC per hour of possession of the book. If \nthe creature fails the saving throw, it is cursed to do horrible things, but there is a chance for \nredemption.  Within 30 days of the book’s grasp, the afflicted individual must be taken to \nconsecrated ground and a daylong ceremony must be performed to purge the evil within the \nafflicted person.  Also, during the ceremony, the following spells must be cast in order—\nremove curse, remove malady, and perfect health.  Anyone cured from the ceremony loses any \nmadness feats gained from the book (and must choose new ones).  Anyone who is not cured \nafter 30 days of becoming dominated by the book is beyond the reach of any mortal magics.  \nAnyone slain while under the possession of the book, will rise to become a cursed shadow \n(see new monster below).  \n \nDestroying the Book: The book cannot be destroyed by conventional means, though through \ndiligent research, the method for destroying the book should be simpler than any method to \ndestroy an artifact. \n \n\n35 \n\n\n\nThe Curse of Menstaugher Manor \n\nNew Monster: Cursed Shadow \nMedium Undead (Incorporeal) \nHit Dice: 6d12 (39 hp) \nInitiative: +5 \nSpeed: Fly 50 ft (perfect) (10 squares) \nArmor Class: 12 (+1 Dex, +1 deflection), touch 12, flat-footed 11 \nBase Attack/Grapple: +2/-- \nAttack: Incorporeal touch +5 melee (1d6 Wis) \nFull Attack: Incorporeal touch +5 melee (1d6 Wis) \nSpace/Reach: 5 ft/5 ft. \nSpecial Attacks: Telekinetic blast, create spawn, wisdom damage \nSpecial Qualities: Darkvision 60 ft, incorporeal traits, undead traits \nSaves: Fort +2, Ref +3, Will +7 \nAbilities: Str--, Dex 13, Con--, Int 8, Wis 15, Cha 14 \nSkills: Hide +5*, Listen +7, Search +4, Spot +5 \nFeats: Improved Initiative, Weapon Finesse (touch), Weapon Focus (touch) \nEnvironment: Usually within 100 ft of any volume of The Book of Nex, but can be encountered \nin dark, ruined areas as well \nOrganization: Solitary, gang (2-5), or swarm (6-11) \nChallenge Rating: 4 \nTreasure: None \nAdvancement: 7-18 HD (Medium) \nLevel Adjustment: -- \n \n\nCreatures of hate, vileness, and destruction that were once living creatures consumed \nby any of the volumes of The Book of Nex and were killed somehow have arisen again in a \nshadowy wispy form of their former selves to serve their dark masters (the books) for all \neternity.  Such is the fate of the cursed shadow. \nWisdom Damage (Su): the touch of a cursed shadow deals 1d6 Wisdom damage to any \nliving creature.  Any creature reduced to 0 Wisdom will die and rise as a cursed shadow \nunder the control of its master the next day. \nTelekinetic Blast (Su): once every 1d4 rounds, the cursed spawn can let its rage and anger \nmanifest itself in the form of a mind blast that spreads out into a 15 ft cone.  Anyone caught \nin the blast must make a Will save DC 15 or suffer 3d4 points of damage.  A successful save \nreduces the damage by half.  Evasion ability does not apply.  Three times per day, a cursed \nshadow can use their telekinetic blast to manipulate non-living things and items up to 100 lbs \nfor 2d6 rounds.  This allows the cursed shadows to open and close doors, reset traps, etc.  \nCreate Spawn (Su): any living creature slain by a cursed shadow will rise as one the next day \nunder the control of the one who slain it. \nIncorporeal Traits: Any corporeal source that attacks the shadow has a 50% chance of failure.  \nThe cursed shadow is not hindered by solid objects and can easily pass through them and \nwhen moving silently cannot be heard.  Only spells with force effects can automatically \nsucceed in hitting a cursed shadow. \n\n36 \n\n\n\nThe Curse of Menstaugher Manor \n\nUndead: a cursed shadow is undead and is immune to mind-affecting effects, necromantic \neffects, poison, sleep, paralysis, stunning, and disease.  It is not subject to critical hits, subdual \ndamage, ability damage, energy drain, or death from massive damage.  \nSkills: a cursed shadow in total darkness is completely invisible.  A cursed shadow in areas \nthat are mostly dark gain a +4 bonus to Hide checks.  A cursed shadow in brightly lit areas \nsuffers a -4 penalty to Hide checks. \n\n37 \n\n\n\nThe Curse of Menstaugher Manor \n\n38 \n\n\n\nThe Curse of Menstaugher Manor \nOPEN GAME LICENSE Version 1.0a  \n \nThe following text is the property of Wizards of the Coast, Inc. and is Copyright 2000 Wizards of the Coast, Inc (\"Wizards\").

The other two parts are:\nModule U1: THE SINISTER SECRET OF SALTMARSH\nModule U3: THE FINAL ENEMY\n\nThe three modules are designed specifically to form a series, characters starting their adventure in U1, progressing through U2 and completing this phase of their careers in U3. Each module is complete in itself and can be played separately if so desired, though it would be more satisfying for players if the same group were to tackle the three modules in order.\n\nThis module is designed for 6-8 characters of experience levels 2-4.\n\nIf the DM has previously supervised the U1 adventures with the same players, those players should already have the necessary information (and have made approximately the right deductions) to enable them to proceed smoothly on to this adventure. Otherwise the DM and players will need to be given a broad outline of the plot of Ul, as set out in the following synopsis.\n\n\nSYNOPSIS OF MODULE U1\n\n(If you intend to play module U1 do not read this! Doing so will spoil your enjoyment of the module.)\n\nRecently the Town Council of Saltmarsh, a small fishing town, hired a party of relatively inexperienced adventurers to investigate mysterious goings-on in the Haunted House, a decaying mansion on the cliff top near the town. These adventurers discovered that the hauntings were a masquerade by a gang of smugglers (led by an illusionist) to provide cover for their illegal use of the house as a land-base for importation of contraband. After a struggle, the adventurers killed some of the smugglers and captured the others, including the leader, and handed them over to the grateful Saltmarsh authorities.\n\nHaving successfully routed this gang, the adventurers turned their attention to the sea-going side of the operation and, with the help of two fishermen from Saltmarsh, managed to board the smugglers' ship Sea Ghost. They were able to defeat the smugglers aboard and could then safely assume that the smuggling operation was quashed. However the unexpected presence on board of three lizard men, the perusal of some curious quasi-commercial documents and the discovery of a secret cache of (non-magical) arms and armour led them to deduce that, for some reason as yet unknown, the smugglers were also running fighting equipment to a colony of lizard men. Their deduction was corroborated by the tale of Oceanus, an aquatic elf held prisoner aboard Sea Ghost, who before his capture witnessed the equipment being loaded. A map discovered in the captain's cabin gives a clue as to the whereabouts of the lizard men's colony.\n\nSpecial Notes:\n\n1.\tA copy of the map showing the location of the lizard men's colony can be found in the APPENDIX.\n\n2.\tSee the APPENDIX for details of Oceanus the aquatic elf, if he is still with the party (assume that he is, if the players have not played U1) and have a player control him.\n\n3.\tIt is possible that a pseudo-dragon, formerly a companion of one of the lizard men, has now formed a companionship with one of the characters, in which case see the APPENDIX for statistics of this creature. If the players have not played module U1, the pseudo-dragon will not be present here.\n \nIMPORTANT: If you are a player read no further - if you do, it could spoil your enjoyment of this module.\n\nPREAMBLE\n\nAs Dungeon Master, it will be for you to set the scene of this adventure. Precisely how you do so depends to a considerable extent on whether the players have experience of module U1 or not. If they have played in U1 they will only need to be told of their invitation to the Council meeting (see INTRODUCTION hereafter) and of what is proposed at that meeting, together with any other information about Saltmarsh, its surroundings and people, such as the characters could reasonably have discovered for themselves.\n\nIf the players have not played in U1 it is strongly recommended that they do so before proceeding to this adventure. If for some reason this is not practicable, then you should introduce them to U2 as if they had played in U1 - read the Synopsis (above) to them and provide them with the information their characters would know about Saltmarsh after living in the town for a week or so. The paragraphs that follow provide background information about Saltmarsh and about this adventure. It is strongly recommended that you read them thoroughly before introducing the players to their characters' mission. In particular note the various complexities which will surround the characters' dealings with lizard men; you will see that in this adventure the cut-and-thrust of diplomacy will be more potent than that of the sword, if the characters are to gain maximum benefit.\n\nSaltmarsh\n\nThe little town of Saltmarsh plays a pivotal role in the series of adventures presented here and in U1 and U3. The Secret of Saltmarsh derives from the nature of the town and its surroundings. Encouragement (and, to a limited extent, financial inducement) of the party to undertake various adventures comes from the Town Council of Saltmarsh. It is to Saltmarsh that the party will repair between adventures. It is within the town, and with its people, that the characters will spend several weeks or even months of their adventuring careers.\n\nIf there is to be an adequate background to each adventure, and particularly if the three modules are to be played as a series, the Dungeon Master is recommended to prepare the town quite thoroughly, using the guidelines presented in this module as the basis of that preparation. The DM's own style and preferences will govern just how much preparation is done and in how much detail, but it is suggested that attention be given to at least some of the following:\n\n1.\tThe Town Council. Name the members; determine their trades/occupations and something of their backgrounds; decide how powerful and wealthy each member is relative to the local community.\n\n2.\tTreat other prominent local citizens who are not members of the Council in a similar way to Council members.\n\n3.\tDraw a map of the town, locating prominent buildings and the places where Council members and other important people carry on their business.\n\n4.\tDecide where the characters could stay when resting between adventures in the town (the best inn? the only inn? Determine the daily cost of their accommodation and food (and make sure they pay!).\n\n5.\tDecide where to locate the town's place(s) of worship and which deity is worshipped in each.\n \nThe D&D hardback books - particularly the relevant sections of the Dungeon Masters Guide - should prove helpful in these tasks. Don't skimp them, for in this series of modules the events that take place between adventures are nearly as important as the adventures themselves. Your players' characters will spend a lot of time in Saltmarsh, so do it - and them - justice!\n\nThe Town is a small, respectable fishing town. The inhabitants are relatively sober, hard working and amiable. There are adequate facilities for justice and law enforcement - debtors and bankrupts are dealt with particularly harshly. Fishing is the main industry but there are some tiny farms in the neighbouring countryside and the town boasts a small weekly market to which traders are attracted from two larger towns - Burle and Seaton - each some twenty miles away (Burle inland to the northwest, Seaton along the coast to the east).\n\nIn general be guided by any small south-coast English fishing town of the 14th Century and with population about 2,000. Saltmarsh is placed at the western edge of hex U4/123 on the WORLD OF GREYHAWK'\" map.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe discovery that a hitherto unknown colony of lizard men is in close proximity to the town of Saltmarsh, and is engaged in the purchase of weaponry that is sophisticated by lizard ma n standards, has thrown the Town Council into dismay and alarm. Greatly troubled and filled with apprehension, they have called an emergency Council meeting that the characters, in recognition of their already proven abilities, are invited to attend.\n\nFrom the crude map found aboard the smugglers' vessel and from information provided by the aquatic elf, Oceanus, it seems likely that the lizard men are preparing for war. The Town Council members devoutly hope that their townspeople are not the intended victims, but greatly fear this possibility.\n\nThe site of the lizard men's colony has been tentatively identified as a coastal promontory adjacent to a small river, the Dunwater, some ten miles south west of Saltmarsh. The Council considers it essential that a scouting party be sent to reconnoitre the area to ascertain the strength and size of this colony and the intentions of the lizard men. This would then enable the citizens of Saltmarsh to undertake proper pre- cautions. It is put to the characters that, on the basis of their past success, they are well suited to undertake this mission. A reward of 5000 gp is offered as an inducement, to be paid on the successful completion of the adventure.\n\nIf the same players have previously played module U1 and if their characters have obtained enough experience points in those adventures to qualify them for promotion it can be assumed that sufficient time is available for them to gain their next experience level. It can also be assumed that any necessary training can be obtained in the larger towns not far from Saltmarsh (at the right price!). In other words, the DM should feel free to waive the stricter requirements for gaining experience levels in the interests of the smooth flow of the adventure-series. During this interim period the adventurers may also re-equip at standard prices, though no magical items should be available for sale.\n\nIf the characters wish to travel by sea to the site of the adventure, the Town Council will place at their disposal an excise cutter - a small craft (3 hull points) with six pairs of oars and a step-down mast, large enough to accommodate the party and any reasonable amount of equipment they may wish to take with them. Navigation and sailing of the craft will be handled competently by two part-time excise officers (see the APPENDIX for details) who will fight hard and assist the party to the best of their abilities (the DM should allow players to control these characters). There will be no encounters en route if the characters travel by sea.\n\nA sum of 400 gp will be requested prior to the party setting out, if they choose to use the cutter; this is to cover (in advance) two weeks hire of the cutter and wages of the excise men. (If more than two weeks pass before the cutter is returned, the additional hire will be waived). In addition, a returnable deposit of 2,500 gp will be required (this sum will be repaid to the characters so long as the vessel is returned in good condition).\n\nIt may be suggested that the characters should sail to the lizard men's lair in Sea Ghost, assuming this vessel has been captured in module U1 .The Dungeon Master should discourage this; the characters are unlikely to have the necessary expertise to man such a large vessel for more than a very short distance and a crew of sufficient size will not be available in Saltmarsh. If necessary, allow the characters one or two attempts to sail the vessel - run it aground on a sandbank or have it meander in a vague and uncontrolled way around the small harbour - to reinforce the message that they must find another way. If the party wish to travel by land across the marshes they may do so, though the Council will advise against it. The marshes are reputed to harbour dangerous monsters and no one from Saltmarsh ventures into them (one reason why no one knew of the lizard men's presence until now). Encounters in the marshes take place according to the table in Encounters - Marshland Areas and there will be one certain encounter en route (see THE GOBLIN AMBUSH).\n\nOceanus will also accompany the party on this adventure if he is still present from module U1 (the APPENDIX gives full details of the aquatic elf).\n\nGENERAL NOTES\n\nIt will be noticed that encounter descriptions are divided into boxed and open sections. The information in the boxed sections should be conveyed to the players together with approximate dimensions of the area (these can be given more accurately if the characters are willing to take time in measurement). Even if not specifically mentioned in the boxed text, describe other features of the area (steps, pillars, etc.) that would be seen without difficulty. Initially the party can act only on this information -- hints are sometimes provided in this text and the DM should only provide vague supporting information if requested. The remaining open sections and all the introductory paragraphs are for the DM alone and should not be conveyed to the players until they discover the facts for themselves.\n\nMAP\n\nA copy of the map showing the location of the lizard man's colony is provided at the rear of this book let. It is perforated so that the DM may detach it and hand it to the players. Note that even if the players have not experienced module U1, they will still get the map - it will have been given to the Town Council by the characters that defeated the smugglers.\n\nBACKGROUND TO THE WAR\n\nWhat has occurred is this. Just over a year ago a colony of lizard men were driven from their original home by a sudden invasion of sahuagin. Forced to find an alternative home, they re-opened and restored an old lizard man stronghold which had been abandoned for decades because it was too close to human settlements for lizard man comfort. It so happens that this stronghold is close to Saltmarsh...\n\nDetermined to regain their ancestral halls from those rapacious marauders, the sahuagin, the lizard men have been busily engaged in purchasing arms and negotiating alliances with other aquatic races for the sole purpose of expelling the sahuagin from their newly acquired fortress and, in so doing, dealing them such a blow as to discourage them from further such enterprises in this area. It is for this reason that embassies from the koalinth, the locathah and the mermen are present in the lizard men's lair. The aquatic elves were not invited to join the alliance because of the intense hatred that exists between them and the koalinth; even in the face of the sahuagin threat no alliance is possible between these two peoples and the lizard men, concluding that the koalinth are the stronger tribe, have invited them rather than the elves. Humanity is a non-aquatic race and so the lizard men have not even considered inviting them to join the proposed alliance - of what use is a race that cannot breathe water in a war against sahuagin? In any case relations between humans and lizard men have never been particularly comfortable. So it is that members of these four disparate races are come together, forced to overlook their previous rivalries and differences, driven by stark necessity to co-operate in the face of a common foe whose rapacity, cruelty and evil is so complete that among all other living creatures they number only sharks their friends - the sahuagin.\n\nHuman involvement in the alliance\n\nIf and when the party learns the true nature of the situation, they may decide to make representation to the lizard man chief for admittance to the alliance on behalf of the people of Saltmarsh, as Oceanus may do on behalf of the aquatic elves. (Indeed, in the right circumstances, the lizard man chief will invite such an approach.) Such representation will be well received by the chief as the koalinth have recently advised him that they will not be joining and will be preparing to quit the lair when the characters reach it. They intend to return to their own people and advise them that their tribe should move far away from this area, leaving it to the Sahuagin, who they consider far too strong to contest.\n\nAdditionally the boldness and resource of the party in entering his lair will have impressed the chief, causing him to reconsider his previous conclusion regarding humanity's inability to render worthwhile assistance against the sahuagin. So, providing the party can offer intelligent and cogent argument in their favour, and will meet the conditions that the chief will lay upon them, an alliance with the lizard men will be agreed to and the party will be able to take this agreement to Saltmarsh (see FORMALISING THE ALLIANCE hereafter).\n\nThese conditions are as follows:\n\nThe party must return to the lizard men all the treasure that was in the lizard men's possession. This does not include the magical long sword from the area 22 nor any items found on the dead elf thief in area 47, as none of these items was ever the property of the lizard men. \n\nAny loot taken from the koalinth, locathah or mermen will arouse no interest in the lizard men and they will not request its return (though if members of the tribe(s) previously owning the treasure are present at the negotiations, they will assuredly demand its return and the DM must adjudge the bargaining carefully). \n\nThe lizard men will be prepared to sell the magical ring from area 24 for as little as 25 gp, since they have no knowledge of its magical properties. Similarly they will sell the Pearl of Wisdom from area 39 for as little as 100 gp unless the old lizard minister is still alive, in which case he will persuade his chief to insist on its return, being fully aware of its nature. The chief will also insist on the return of the staff of the python from area 20, refusing to consider selling it at any price.\n\nThe chief will insist on the party paying the tribe wergild for each and every one of his people the adventurers have killed. His asking price will be a round 10 gp for each male, female and egg (and since it is unreasonable to expect the DM to keep accurate count of fatalities, the sum total of wergild demanded can be approximated). The chief will be prepared to negotiate the wergild payment, though not to the extent of waiving it altogether even if this is the only way of ensuring that humans join the alliance.\n\nIMPORTANT NOTE: This is the trickiest aspect of the whole adventure for the DM to regulate. It will be quite possible for the party simply to mount an offensive against the lizard men, trying to kill all they encounter; this would mean that their chances of learning the lizard men's true intentions are slim, and would cause some problems in the linking of this adventure with module U3.\n\nHowever if the party does get to the stage of negotiations with the lizard men, problems of a different nature arise. Obviously the adventurers would be reluctant to return to the lizard men all but a few items of treasure, yet it would be most unreasonable were the lizard man chief not to demand this. The solution, in game terms, is probably to allow the characters full experience point credit for all treasure so returned, though the DM may prefer another solution (in which case remember the two constraints - the formation of an alliance must not be inhibited yet the characters must gain advantage from co-operating).\n\nThe wergild matter is even more problematical. On the one hand the chief must insist on some recompense for losses - all other reasons apart, his high rank would soon be removed if he failed to press the point. On the other hand one can imagine the players' reaction to the suggestion that they should pay for their adventuring, particularly since they have probably given nearly all the treasure back already! Some solution in game terms must be found for this. Again, the constraints are quite simple - the chief must get some payment but the characters must be encouraged to forge the alliance so that the adventure can continue to module U3; additionally at least some characters should make significant experience points gains in this adventure.\n\nA number of solutions may be worthy of examination, and some are suggested below. The DM may wish to evolve a personal solution, based on one or more suggestions but involving other terms. Whatever the case, an answer must be found if the adventure is to be credible yet the game not discouraging to the players.\n\nAnother possibility is included in the module proper (see OPTIONAL VENTURE). This supposes that the lizard men have found a major drawback to their present (and they hope temporary) abode -- the presence of a giant crocodile in the marshes nearby. The lizard man chief might (DM's option) be willing to waive payment of the wergild altogether if the party were to put an end to this menace. For full details refer to OPTIONAL VENTURE.\n\nShould the lizard man chief be killed in the course of this adventure, he will be succeeded by the sub chief. Should he too be killed, the succession will go to one of warrior officers. If all of these are slain, then succession falls to the most senior surviving shaman. In this event (see LIZARD MEN POLITICAL STRUCTURE) the shaman will denounce the alliance, pull the lizard people out of it, sacrifice the aged lizard man minister to the lizard men's deity Semuanya and lead the remainder of tribe into the depths of the Hool Marshes beyond the reach of the sahuagin. If all the lizard men notables are slain, surviving members of the tribe will simply drift away into the marshes taking all of their possessions with them, and disappear from the adventure.\n\nHowever even if all the lizard men leave or are slain, the mermen and the locathah will remain allied and will urge the party to make representation to the authorities in Saltmarsh to join them in war against the sahuagin, and they will urge the same on Oceanus with regard to the aquatic elves. The koalinth, of course, are already determined to leave and will have nothing to do with the alliance, particularly now that the lizard men are gone and the aquatic elves may well be taking their place.\n\nSpecial notes\n\nThe Dungeon Master must on no account reveal to the party that the lizard men constitute no real threat to Saltmarsh or its inhabitants, or that the newly purchased weaponry is not primarily for use against humanity or its allied races. The real intentions of the lizard men must be discovered by the party for themselves from the various clues contained in the module as they adventure through it, and they must be left to deduce for themselves (unless circumstances develop in such a way that the lizard men volunteer this information) that there is a war between the lizard men (and their allies) and the sahuagin.\n\nIn any encounters with sahuagin, either alive or dead, the party must not be informed as to the name or nature of this race; rather, the Dungeon Master must give only a general physical description of these creatures as and when an encounter occurs, unless the contrary is indicated in a particular encounter area within the module. However if Oceanus is with the party then he will recognize these creatures on sight as well as having a good general knowledge as to their nature, and he will readily identify them to the rest of the party.\n\nFormalising the alliance\n\nIn the event that the characters come to terms with the lizard men and agree to ally with them, they could do so unilaterally and without any reference to the Saltmarsh Town Council. However the characters will no doubt wish to re-equip and rest before their next adventure (in which case it would be natural for them to do so in Saltmarsh) and in any event they may consider it prudent to inform the Town Council, not only to obtain political backing but also in the hope that the Council will provide them with some doughty men-at-arms (they will assuredly need them against the sahuagin).\n\nThe lizard men, if still involved at this stage, will despatch an officer and the senior shaman to Saltmarsh with the party as ambassadors. They will be well received by the Council and the alliance will quickly be formalised once the Council members are apprised of the situation regarding the sahuagin.\n\nLIZARD MEN POLITICAL STRUCTURE\n\nIt is important to note that within the social structure of the lizard men's lair there are two political groupings. On the one hand are the dominant progressives, led by the chief, supported by the sub chief and officers and including the warrior males but whose inspiration and driving force is the aged lizard man minister. Opposing them (but only covertly as yet, for the will of the chief is still paramount) are the conservatives led by all the shamans and including the females. The shamans hold that all allying and intercourse with other races is contrary to the divine will and nature of their god, Semuanya, and that no good can come of it. As a consequence the shamans hate and distrust the aged lizard man minister as the prime agent of these innovations that go against all nature, but they dare not, as yet, move openly against him as he enjoys the trust and favour of the chief.\n\nNOTE: If somehow it transpires, during the course of the adventure, that the chief, the sub-chief and the officers are killed, then the surviving shamans will become openly hostile to the party and the other visiting embassies alike. There will then be no chance of an anti-sahuagin alliance involving lizard men.\n\nTHE JOURNEY TO THE LAIR\n\nThe distance from Saltmarsh to the lair is about ten miles as the crow flies and a sea-borne journey would take about 4 hours in normal conditions.\n\nThe overland journey is longer because of the difficult terrain through which characters have to travel. There are a number of track ways and it would be possible to follow a route roughly parallel to the coast and 100-400 yards from it. Because of the type of terrain it will normally take a party about 12 hours travelling time to travel from Saltmarsh to the ford near the lair (marked B on the map). This makes no allowances for resting but does allow for slow movement at times when the mist inhibits visibility. So long as the party moves at this rate, the route is easily followed - there is no risk of straying in a wrong direction.\n\nWhereas there will be no encounters if a sea-borne journey is made, there will certainly be one encounter in the marshes and possibly more (if rolled on the MARSHLAND ENCOUNTER TABLE). The one certain encounter will take place about 8 miles from Saltmarsh and 3 miles from the lair at a place where a band of goblins will attack the party (see THE GOBLIN AMBUSH).\n\nThe lizard men's lair is located beneath a promontory running out from the marshlands into the sea. This takes the form of a mound-like hill or dun that rises up abruptly from the surrounding countryside. The entire area is boggy, wet and - to all outward appearances - devoid of intelligent life. Vegetation consists mainly of tall grasses and reeds, some low-lying shrubs and a few trees of willow and thorn acacia. However, the height and density of this vegetation is sufficient to provide adequate cover for the party, when using reasonable caution, to approach unobserved the landward entrances to the lizard men's lair. A careful approach to the sea cave entrance (marked E on the map) will also go unnoticed until the characters actually enter the entrance tunnel, then discovery will be automatic.\n\nThe marsh abounds with sea birds and marsh fowl and many varieties of small, harmless lizards; there are also large numbers of butterflies, dragonflies, blackflies and mosquitoes, while normal fish and frogs will be seen in the many streams and pools. From dusk to early morning the marshes and adjacent coastal waters will be wreathed in thick but low-lying mists, to a height of about 20 feet; however, the middle reaches and crown of the lair will be clear of these at all times. These mists will limit normal vision to 10 feet but once the sun has risen they quickly dissipate and vision range becomes normal.\n\nThere are many pools and meres of varying depth within the marshes, mostly shallow though a few are deep, and small streams run between and connect these together. None of these, or the marshes themselves, is of a sufficient depth or magnitude upon which to sail the party's boat. The mouth of the river Dunwater is blocked by a delta that is impassable by any boat.\n\nWhile at sea, as their boat approaches the promontory, the party will be able to make out a track way (at the point marked A on the map) leading from the coast and disappearing into the marshland interior. Once they are within 40 feet of the promontory's northern coastline, they will also be able to see another track way running up to the middle heights of the promontory to disappear behind a clump of tall grasses and shrubs (leading to the hidden entrance marked D on the map). They will also note, as they approach by sea, a sea cave entrance some 15 feet wide by six feet high, on the north eastern tip of the promontory (marked E on the map). This leads, by way of a short 15 feet wide by six feet high tunnel, into area 49 and the party may readily row the cutter into this area if they first let down their mast. From the ford (marked B on the map) the party will be able to see the entrance to the cave of the giant lizards (area 22, marked C on the map).\n\nThe marsh track ways are all approximately five feet wide and firm enough to allow normal movement rate during low tide, and in daylight are easily followed. However, at night and during periods when the mist is present, there is al in 4 chance per turn, per individual, that party members will wander off the track way into the marsh. When this occurs, movement rate is slowed by 50 per cent and there is a 1 in 12 chance per turn, per individual, that errant party members will stumble into a bog pit which will swallow them in one melee round, with death occurring in a further four melee rounds, unless they are extricated.\n\nENCOUNTER TABLES\n\nThere are two encounter tables that are mutually exclusive. The first is for use only when the party is in the marsh area, the second only when the party is in the lair proper. (There are no encounters at sea.)\n\nEncounters - marshland area\n\nEncounter occurs on a 1 in 8 while on the track ways, on a 1 in 8 if off the track ways in the marsh. In either case, check once every two hours and if an encounter is indicated roll ld10 to determine what creatures are encountered.\n\n1-2\tTwo large vipers\n3-4 \tOne huge viper\n5-6 \tOne giant lizard\n7-8 \tThree normal crocodiles\n\nLARGE VIPER, Medium-Sized Animal \n\nHit Dice\t2d8 (10 hit points)\nInitiative\t+3 (Dex)\nSpeed\t20 feet, Climb 20 feet, Swim 20 feet\nAC\t16 (+3 Dex, +3 natural)\nAttacks\tBite +4 melee\nDamage\tBite 1d4-1 and poison\nSpecial Attacks\tPoison\nSpecial Qualities\tScent\nSaves\tFort +2, Ref +6, Will +1\nAbilities\tStr 8, Dex 17, Con 11, Int 1, Wis 12, Cha 2\nSkills\tBalance +11, Climb +11, Hide +12, Listen +9, Spot +9\nFeats\tWeapon Finesse (bite)\nNotes:\tPoison: Fortitude save (DC 11).

If it gets a hold, the crocodile grabs the opponent with its mouth and drags it into deep water, attempting to pin it to the bottom. The crocodile automatically deals bite damage each round it maintains the pin.\n\nTHE GOBLIN AMBUSH\n\nAt a point some 8 miles from Saltmarsh and 3 miles from the lair the party will pass close to the temporary lair of a band of goblins. The goblin scouts will detect the approach of the party without themselves being detected so the main body of goblins will be able to prepare their ambush and mount a surprise attack.\n\nThe goblins are a roving band - this is not their normal home - but have formalised a camp here because they have happened upon a considerable treasure that contains items quite outside their normal experience. Though they do not recognise the full value of some of the items in the treasure, they are sensible enough to realise that here are some items of very considerable value and have formed a defensive camp to guard their discovery until their Great Chief arrives from his lair some 50 miles away. In great awe of their Chief, the goblins dare make no move with the items they have found until he gives his decision on the matter. So they wait, having despatched messages to the Chief, nervously guarding their find; they are alert and well prepared - no party could pass c lose to their temporary camp without the goblins' knowledge. On the other hand, no approaching party will detect the goblins' presence in the area until the monsters attack.\n\nThere are 25 goblins in the band (10 more have been despatched to inform the Great Chief; they, the Great Chief and his retinue are still some distance away and do not appear in this adventure). They comprise two leaders and 23 warriors.\n\nGOBLIN LEADER, 2nd level fighter\n\nHit Dice\t2d8+4 (18 hit points)\nInitiative\t+1 (Dex)\nSpeed\t30 feet\nAC\t17 (+1 size, +1 Dex, +3 studded leather, +2 magical shield)\nAttacks\tShort sword +4 melee, javelin +3 ranged\nDamage\tShort sword 1d6+1, Javelin 1d6+1\nSpecial Qualities\tDarkvision 60 feet\nSaves\tFort +4, Ref +1, Will +0\nAbilities\tStr 13, Dex 13, Con 13, Int 10, Wis 11, Cha 8\nSkills\tHide +6, Listen +3, Move Silently +4, Spot +3\nFeats\tAlertness, Weapon focus (shortsword), Expertise\nNotes:\tThe leader carries a small shield +1\n\nGOBLIN LEADER, 2nd level rogue\n\nHit Dice\t2d6+2 (12 hit points)\nInitiative\t+2 (Dex)\nSpeed\t30 feet\nAC\t15 (+1 size, +2 Dex, +2 leather)\nAttacks\tDagger +1 melee, javelin +3 ranged\nDamage\tDagger 1d4, Javelin 1d6\nSpecial Qualities\tDarkvision 60 feet\nSaves\tFort +1, Ref +5, Will +0\nAbilities\tStr 10, Dex 15, Con 12, Int 11, Wis 11, Cha 8\nRogue abilities\tSneak Attack +1d6, Evasion\nSkills\tClimb +4, Disable Device +3, Hide +10, Intuit Direction +4, Listen +10, \n\tMove Silently +10, Search +7, Spot +7\nFeats\tAlertness\n\nGOBLIN WARRIOR, Small Humanoid\n\nHit Dice\t1d8 (5 hit points)\nInitiative\t+1 (Dex)\nSpeed\t30 feet\nAC\t15 (+1 size, +1 Dex, +3 studded leather)\nAttacks\tClub +0 melee, javelin +3 ranged\nDamage\tClub 1d6-1, Javelin 1d6-1\nSpecial Qualities\tDarkvision 60 feet\nSaves\tFort +2, Ref +1, Will +0\nAbilities\tStr 8, Dex 13, Con 11, Int 10, Wis 11, Cha 8\nSkills\tHide +6, Listen +3, Move Silently +4, Spot +3\nFeats\tAlertness\n\nThe goblins will fight to the death but when they have been dealt with, their treasure is not difficult to find and the party will soon discover an unlocked chest, its lid closed, roughly hidden in a clump of reeds. The chest contains:\n\n550 gp\n\n5 rubies each of 250 gp base value\n\nIn a leather pouch, two stones (one pale green prism and one deep red sphere). The prism is an ioun stone, while the sphere is worth 500gp. The prism provides a +1 competence bonus to attack rolls, saves and checks. See Dungeon Master’s Guide page 220 for more information. \n\nA Helm of Underwater Action. The wearer of the helm can see five times further than normal underwater. If a command word is spoken, the helm creates a globe of air around the wearer’s head, enabling her to breathe freely. See Dungeon Master’s Guide page 219 for more information. The command word for this item is STYX and those letters are engraved lightly on the rear of the Helm itself.\n\nThe goblins have no treasure apart from the shield carried by the fighter.\n\nSTANDARD DUNGEON FEATURES\n\nThe lizard men in this particular colony are more highly developed than others of their kind, as witnessed by their ability to use sophisticated weaponry and their readiness to ally with other races when necessity so dictates. However, they still lag behind other more intelligent races so that the construction of their lair is simplistic, employing only basic materials; most floors, walls and ceilings are of rammed earth while the furnishings are, in general, spartan. Moreover only the chief, sub chief, the two senior shamans and the five warrior officers can speak the common tongue, while the aged lizard man minister speaks common and is literate in it too. All other lizard men speak only their own tongue and are illiterate.\n\nWithin the lair all corridors are 10 feet wide by 12 feet high, all room areas are 12 feet high except for areas 10, 11, 12, 22, 24, 25,36 and 40 that are 15 feet high. For the height of the sea caves (areas 49, 50, 51, 52) see the area descriptions. All doors (except those in areas 42 and 43 which are of iron-bound solid wood) are of stout wooden construction, 5 feet wide by 8 feet high, and require open doors die rolls to open. The pathways through area 22, 49, 50, 51 and 52 are of stone construction and are 10 feet wide; they stand above the general surface of those areas. All pillars are of wood 3 feet in diameter, are mounted on stone pedestals and support wooden ceiling crossbeams. Lighting is good throughout, being provided by torches set in iron brackets on the walls at regular intervals, except for areas 26 and 47 that are unlit and dark. Area 22 is also dark at night, since the lizard men have deliberately not provided torches on the east wall to avoid lights being noticed from outside the lair.\n\nThe lizard men in this colony are nervous and on edge - highly suspicious of any intrusion. They are fearful of a sahuagin invasion, and in addition, not many weeks before the adventure, the lair was raided by a party of humans and half-orcs who were only dealt with at the cost of many lizard man lives.\n\nSo, with the exception of the aged lizard man minister in area 38, all the lizard men will be intensely suspicious of the party as they dislike uninvited intruders. They will not attack at first sight unless the party has committed an act that provokes their hostility. However the party will be curtly challenged and - unless they think up a suitable story - ordered to leave by word or gesture, their refusal automatically prompting an attack. In such an attack the lizard men's first priority will be the ejection, rather than the death, of the party, but they will view any fatality with unconcern and will, if necessary, fight to the death once provoked. If the party do call upon the lizard man chief (or if he should be slain, his successor) for a truce and parley, then this one creature will halt the attacks of his people and agree to listen to the party's proposals.\n\nPersonal possessions\n\nIn normal circumstances every lizard man would immerse his body frequently in water and swimming is a popular recreation. The lizard men in the lair dare not indulge themselves in this way for fear of encountering sahuagin; the result is that a lizard man's skin would become dry and the lizard man would suffer discomfort unless an alternative to swimming is found. For this reason each inhabitant of the lair oils its skin regularly using a light vegetable oil applied with a cloth.\n\nWhen exploring the lair, the characters will find each lizard man has its own personal supply of oil and cloths (the latter of the garish colours which lizard men find attractive) - every locker and chest will contain at least one flask of oil and a handful of cloths, unless specific mention to the contrary is made in the text. The DM should include these items in any description of the contents of the locker; cupboard etc. even though, to avoid repetition, the text relating to individual encounter areas simply mentions 'personal possessions'. Additionally, each time a lizard man's possessions are searched they will be found to include various leather belts and straps; again the DM should mention these even though they are not repeated throughout the text. These items are simply to enable a lizard man to equip with weapons while leaving the arms free.\n\nENCOUNTERS - LIZARD MEN'S LAIR AREA\n\nEncounter occurs on a 1 in 12, check each turn. Use ld10 to determine which creatures are encountered if an encounter is indicated.\n\nAs wanderers within the lair are drawn only from specific encounter areas, the Dungeon Master must take care that monsters slain or captured as wanderers do not later reappear within their given encounter areas, and that monsters slain or captured within their given encounter areas do not later reappear as wanderers.\n\nSee the APPENDIX and the appropriate encounter area for full details of all creatures encountered.\n\n1-2\tThe lizard man officer and seven lizard man warriors from area 3.\n\n3-4\tThe lizard man officer, 4 HD shaman and nine lizard man warriors from area 9.\n\n5-6\tThe lizard man officer with eight of the lizard man warriors from area 29.\n\n7-9\tThree lizard man females from area 24.\n\n10\tLizard man chief and sub chief from area 40. When these two are encountered as wanderers both will fight vigorously but the chief, if he sees things going badly for him, will leave the sub chief to try to hold off the party while he runs for reinforcements to the nearest barracks. He will then return with all the occupants of that area in the minimum time required to move at full rate between those two areas.\n\nLIZARD MEN - REPLACEMENT OF LOSSES\n\nShould the party, during the adventure, retire temporarily from the lair for the purposes of rest and recuperation, they will find on their return that lizard man losses have been 50 per cent replaced by returning hunting and foraging parties. Further, wanderers will now be encountered one chance in eight and all guards will be alert and incapable of being surprised. Other creatures such as the giant lizards, the amphisbaena and the embassies from allied races will not be so replaced.\n\nIf the party retire for a second time, then again lizard men losses will be replaced by 50 per cent and wanderers will be encountered one chance in six; other conditions will be as the first retirement.\n\nOn a third retirement by the party there will be no lizard men replacements, but the lizard man scouts will automatically discover the party's camp, if within the swamp and no more than 10 miles from the lair; the remaining lizard men warriors will make an all out attack on the party there in a fight to the finish.\n\nKEY TO THE LIZARD MEN'S LAIR\n\nNOTE: Standard specifications for lizard man infants, women, warriors and officers are given in the APPENDIX.\n\n1. NORTH ENTRANCE (marked D on outdoor map)\n\nA stout wooden door, closed but not locked, blocks a short tunnel whose entrance is concealed by shrubs and tall grasses.\n\nThe party will have to search carefully to find this entrance (detect as concealed portal) since the track which leads in this direction appears to come to an abrupt halt, the lizard men being careful to conceal the 20 feet section of track nearest the door.\n\n2. GUARD ROOM\n\nA bare room; the only items of furniture are two wooden benches, set opposite each other against the longer walls.\n\nThere are five lizard man warriors here at all times. All are armed with morning stars and carry small shields. They are alert and more than one attempt to open the entrance door (area 1) will negate any chance of surprising them. If the party approach this area without the benefit of surprise, appropriate magic or special ability, one of the guards will come out to see who is there; on seeing the party he will shout out to his comrades and then challenge the party. The other guards will join him immediately but if a fight develops one of them will try to run back to the barracks (area 3) whence he will return with reinforcements with in three rounds. None of the guards carries any treasure.\n\n3.BARRACKS\n\nThirteen single straw mattresses a re set around the room against the walls. Beside each is a closed wooden chest. In the centre of the room is a long plain wooden table with two wooden benches set beside it.\n\nThere are seven lizard man warriors in this room forming up under an officer to go on patrol within the lair. Two are armed with two javelins each while the other five are armed with morning stars and carry small shields. One of the latter wears a fine silver chain with an ivory plaque around his neck (value 3 gp). The officer is armed with a broadsword, carries a medium sized shield and wears a silver neck collar, value 15 gp. He carries in his belt pouch the key to his chest in area 4.\n\nIf they are summoned as reinforcements against the party by the guard from area 2 then the officer will take the two javelin-bearing warriors with him out of the south-facing exit, along the corridor to turn north towards area 1 and attack the party from there. The five warriors armed with morning stars will be ordered by the officer to go through area 2 and attack the party from there. Should a melee take place in this area, the noise of combat will attract the attention of the officer in area 5 and he will arrive to join the combat after three melee rounds. \n\nThe chests are all unlocked and untrapped; each contains personal possessions. Some chests also contain one or two additional items each - select as appropriate and at random from the following:\n\n2-8 sp in a leather purse (four chests total)\nAn additional flask of vegetable oil (three chests total)\nA dagger in a scabbard\nA wooden mallet\nA crude wooden flute\nA rough pewter mug\n\n4. OFFICER'S QUARTERS\n\nA wooden table with two wooden chairs are in the centre of the room; there is a wooden bowl containing fruit on the table. Against the west wall there is a single bed at the foot of which is a brassbound wooden chest.\n\nThis is the room normally occupied by the officer in area 3. The chest is locked (the key is in the officer's belt pouch) but not trapped. It contains personal possessions, a morning star, a leather purse containing 50 ep and a chunk of violet-coloured crystal. The last item appears quite valuable but is in fact worthless.\n\n5. OFFICER'S QUARTERS\n\nA wooden table is set against the north wall; on it there are an earthenware jug of cider and a wooden cup. A crude wooden chair stands by the table. A single bed is against the west wall with a brass bound, wooden chest against its foot. A lizard man officer is seated on his bed, facing the door, while sharpening his broadsword with a whetstone.\n\nThe chest is locked (the key is in the officer's belt pouch) but not trapped. It contains personal possessions, a purse containing 25 ep, a dagger in a scabbard and a leather whip. The officer is armed with a broadsword and normally carries a medium-sized shield that is lying on the floor at his feet. He wears a silver collar around his neck, value 15 gp.\n\nIf combat occurs here the noise will, within three melee rounds, bring the officer with two warriors from area 3; if combat lasts a further three rounds then the remainder of the occupants from area 3 will arrive.\n\n6. ARMOURY\n\nThis room appears to be a store for arms and armour. Hanging around the walls are shields of all sizes, while there are some javelins stacked in wooden racks against the north wall and three large, wooden chests, all closed, line the east wall.\n\nThe chests are neither locked nor trapped. One contains 10 broadswords; the other two contain 10 morning stars each. None of the weapons is magical.\n\n7. KITCHEN\n\nIf the party members pause in the corridor anywhere near the door to this room, they are likely to detect a smell in the air; it will remind them of cooking meat though will have an acrid tang to it. This is the odour emitted from the roasting carcasses. Similarly, even if they do not pause specifically to listen, they are likely to hear chattering, muffled turning of the spits etc., as the lizard man women go about their business.\n\nA draught of warm air wafts gently through the door as you open it into what is obviously a kitchen. At one end of the room is a large open fire-pit in which a bed of coals burns. Over it are arranged two spit mechanisms, each carrying a half-cooked carcass, which are being turned by lizard man women (four total, one at each end of each spit). A fifth female appears to be basting the carcasses with a liquid spooned from a wooden bucket she is carrying. In the centre of the room is a long wooden table on which there lies an assortment of implements - knives, cleavers and a saw - together with some gobbets of raw meat and what appear to be splinters of bone.\n\nOn the floor beneath the table are some raw hides; beside the table are two large wooden buckets.\n\nAgainst the south wall there is a large wooden cabinet with shelves on which are piled sundry clay pots, bowls and basins and trenchers. Against the west wall stand three large, wooden barrels; against the east wall stands an open wood cask, containing a white crystalline substance, and three wooden buckets. A large empty iron cauldron hangs from the ceiling on an adjustable chain and hook high over the fire pit.\n\nAll items in this room are normal for the place - none is valuable or have more than passing interest. The carcasses are those of a sahuagin and a shark (beyond saying one appears humanoid, and the other large and fish- like, do not identify them specifically). The hides under the table are of those creatures while the buckets under the table contain their entrails and edible organs (heart, brain, liver etc.) respectively.\n\nThe basting liquid is a light, spiced oil. Two of the barrels contain fresh water while the third is half full of brine. The cask contains salt. Two of the buckets by the east wall contain herbs while the third holds rendered animal fats.\n\nThe lizard man women will only fight if they outnumber the party members or if they are cornered and cannot flee, otherwise they will escape to the nearest barracks whose occupants will return to the kitchen in the shortest possible time. The females are wearing a number of trinkets of worth less jewellery.\n\n8. STQRE\n\nHanging from hooks set into the ceiling are six carcasses of various shapes and sizes. Against the south wall are four open barrels and a lidless wicker basket. Against the west wall there are three large clay jars, a wooden chest and a sealed barrel. Opposite, against the east wall, is a large wooden cage in which a number of marsh fowl are fluttering about.\n\nThe carcasses are those of a manta ray, a giant frog, an adult male gnoll, two sharks and a giant crayfish. The DM should describe these in more detail, if asked to do so, without specifically naming them.\n\nThe open barrels contain, respectively: apples, pears, mixed nuts and brine in which is pickled the carcass of a giant constrictor snake. The wicker basket contains wild cherries.\n\nThe three jars are filled with light, edible oil; the chest is full of wild herbs and the sealed barrel is full of salt. The marsh fowl are quite ordinary.\n\n9. BARRACKS\n\nFifteen straw mattresses are placed around the room, each with a small wooden chest at its foot. A long table is in the centre of the room with wooden benches to each side. Nine lizard man warriors are being formed up by an officer for patrol duties. Another lizard man - dressed in a robe - stands to one side observing the assembly.\n\nThree of the warriors are armed with two javelins each; the other six are armed with morning stars and carry shields. One of the latter wears a fine silver chain with an ivory plaque around his neck (value 15 gp).\n\nThe officer is armed with a broadsword and carries a shield. He wears a silver collar around his neck, value 15 gp. The other lizard man is the senior shaman (druid); he carries a staff and wears a silver collar set with pearls around his neck, value 15 gp. See Appendix for full statistics of the senior shaman.\n\nThe chests (all unlocked and untrapped) contain personal possessions. In each of five chests there is a purse containing 2-8 sp; one chest also contains a whetstone, another a dagger in a scabbard, and a third a crude wooden carving of a crocodile. Determine the contents of each chest at random or place the items in specific chests beforehand.\n\n10. BANQUET HALL\n\nSeveral long plain wooden tables are placed end to end in the centre of the hall with wooden benches running along each side. At the south end head of the composite table is a single, large wooden chair; at the same table end on either side, flanking the large single chair and facing each other, are four slightly smaller chairs, two each side of the table. Placed on the tables are a variety of earthenware pots, jars, plates and mugs, a number of trenchers and some woven baskets containing leaves. Against each of the west and east walls is a tall wooden cupboard. Five lizard man females are here, busy laying the table.\n\nThe females will not fight unless they outnumber the party members encountered or are cornered and cannot escape, otherwise they will flee to the nearest barracks whose occupants will return to this area as quickly as possible. These females have no treasure with them though all are wearing worthless trinkets.\n\nThe cupboards contain extra mugs, platters, bowls and so forth.\n\n11.THRONE ROOM\n\nThis is clearly a ceremonial chamber of some sort. Six pillars, three each to your left and right, flank a central area at the far end of which a wooden throne stands on a low stone dais. The throne appears to be decorated with carvings and glints of reflected light hint at the presence of gem stones inset into the carvings.\n\nTo either side there hang on the walls the heads of several creatures, each mounted on a piece of wood as if they were trophies.\n\nTwo lizard man children are playing in the centre area.\n\nThe children, one male and one female, are equivalent to human children of about four years old; they have wandered into here from area 24. They have no treasure and are quite harmless and unafraid; on encountering the party they will evidence great curiosity for these, to them, strange beings. Unless very firmly discouraged, they will attach themselves to the party and follow them wherever they go; they will be virtually impossible to lose and will make a general nuisance of themselves.\n\nThe throne is carved with snakes and lizards. Twenty translucent stones of a blue-green colour have been inset to form the eyes of these creatures. These are of worthless quartz though to the unskilled eye they will appear reasonably valuable.\n\nThe trophy heads are:\n\nWest wall going north to south: giant crayfish, carrion crawler, hippopotamus, gnoll, and sahuagin.\nEast wall going north to south: brown bear, lion, shark, giant frog, and another shark.\n\nThe DM should not name the creatures but simply give a detailed physical description, leaving the party members to make the identifications. If Oceanus is with the party, however, he will be able to identify the sharks, the giant frog, the giant crayfish and the sahuagin.\n\nBeneath the seat of the throne is a small secret compartment roughly semi-circular and about 5 inches in diameter (detect as a secret door). It contains the key to the treasure chest in area 26. Behind the throne is a secret trapdoor in the floor (detect as secret door) that opens onto a vertical shaft 5 feet square and 20 feet deep. There are iron handrails set into the side of the shaft. It descends to a tunnel, 10 feet wide by 10 feet high, which leads to another identical vertical shaft ascending into area 34. There are neither light nor occupants in either shaft or the tunnel.\n\n12. TEMPLE\n\nA sickly-sweet perfume hangs rather oppressively in the air here. You can readily identify this room as a place of worship - at the far end a large stone altar is centrally placed; at each end of the altar there are small burners, both lit, while in its centre is a candelabrum with four lit candles. Above the altar the south wall is decorated with a large painting of a marine scene dominated by a lizard man figure brandishing a club.\n\nBlue and green drapes cover the entire east and west walls.\n\nIf the shaman is unaware of the intrusion, announce his position - kneeling at the altar with his back to the party. He carries a staff (if he is at prayer the staff will be on the floor beside him) and wears a silver collar set with coral (value 25 gp) around his neck. See Appendix for statistics of a 2nd level shaman.\n\nThe shaman knows that the altar is hollow, as do his colleagues the other shamans and the chief, but no other occupants of the lair. There is a one-foot diameter hole at the bottom of the centre of the front panel concealed by a prayer stoop (detect as concealed panel). Inside the altar lives a huge viper.\n\nThe shamans have trained this creature as the guardian of the altar. It will attack any and all, including lizard men, who approach within 10 feet of the altar with the exception of the chief and the shamans.\n\nThe reactions of the shaman in the temple will depend on whether or not he is aware of the party entering. If given enough time he will attempt to flee to his fellow shamans in area 20 with whom he will return within four rounds. If he finds that the occupants of area 20 have gone or have been slain, he will then try to reach area 40 and return with all the occupants within six rounds. If they too have gone or have been slain, he will then go to the nearest barracks and return with the occupants within one turn; if they are gone or slain he will flee from the lair and never be seen again.\n\nIf he cannot escape and is obliged to fight, he will endeavour to do so within a 10-foot area of the altar so bringing the viper to his assistance.\n\nThe mural is of Semuanya, the lizard men's deity. The club illustrated is set with sharp-looking seashells.\n\nOn the altar are two tridents and two folded nets (war trophies taken from the sahuagin and offered up to Semuanya). The candelabrum is worth 100 gp. The burners on the altar are silver incense burners worth 50 gp each.\n\nHUGE VIPER, Huge Animal \n\nHit Dice\t4d8+4 (22 hit points)\nInitiative\t+4 (Dex)\nSpeed\t20 feet, Climb 20 feet, Swim 20 feet\nAC\t15 (-2 size, +4 Dex, +3 natural)\nAttacks\tBite +5 melee\nDamage\tBite 1d4 and poison\nSpecial Attacks\tPoison\nSpecial Qualities\tScent\nSaves\tFort +5, Ref +8, Will +2\nAbilities\tStr 10, Dex 19, Con 13, Int 1, Wis 12, Cha 2\nSkills\tBalance +12, Climb +12, Hide +3, Listen +9, Spot +9\nFeats\tWeapon Finesse (bite)\nNotes:\tPoison: Fortitude save (DC 13).

They detect creatures within 30 feet and can discern their direction as a partial action.\n\n13. VESTRY\n\nThere are seven carved wooden masks, representing crocodile and serpent faces, hanging from the walls of this room. The masks are decorated with blue and green feathers. Against the west wall stands an iron chest, its lid closed.\n\nHidden in one of the masks (determine at random) is the key to the chest. The chest is trapped; the trap will be sprung (unless previously detected and disarmed) when the chest lid is raised, whether the key has been used or not, releasing a billowing cloud of green gas which fills the entire room in one segment. Those inhaling the gas must make a Fortitude save (DC 12) or go to sleep for four to seven turns. (Thus the gas is not particularly dangerous but there is no reason why the DM should let the players know this).\n\nThe chest contains:\n\nA silver gong and striker, worth 100 gp;\nFive silver bells worth 10 gp each;\nA curved wooden horn of no value;\nA large silver chalice worth 200 gp.\n\n14-17. SHAMANS' QUARTERS\n\nThese rooms, though not identical, are very similar to each other and the following description will serve for any one of them.\n\nThis is a bare, cell-like room. It contains a plain wooden table and chair, a straw mattress and a small wooden chest.\n\nThe positions of the furniture vary from room to room (see the map inside the module folder). All the chests are unlocked and untrapped. Each contains personal possessions and also contains a small statuette of Semuanya (two carved in ivory, one carved in bone, the fourth made of brass). These are of no value to the party but are regarded as very valuable by the shamans.\n\nThe chests also contain other items:\n\nRoom 14\ta wooden club and a leather purse containing 10 ep.\nRoom 15\ta silver buckle worth five gp, a leather purse containing 20 sp, and a long, brilliantly coloured bird's feather (no value).\nRoom 16\ta leather purse containing seven ep.\nRoom 17\ta bolt of blue-green cloth (no value) and a pouch containing 25 sp.\n\nThere are no lizard men in any of the rooms.\n\n18. SENIOR SHAMAN'S LIVING QUARTERS\n\nA wooden table with two chairs is set against the south wall. On the table are a carafe, a cup and a wicker basket containing fruit. A smaller table stands against the north wall; on it stands an unlit incense burner.\n\nThe carafe, cup and incense burners are of silver and are worth 25 gp, 5 gp and 10 gp respectively. Hidden inside the burner is a small key that will unlock the chest in Room 19. The room is unoccupied.\n\n19. SENIOR SHAMAN'S SLEEPING QUARTERS\n\nA single cot bed stands by the south wall; at its foot is an iron chest. Hanging from the east wall is a large wooden carving of a lizard man brandishing a club. The key to the chest is hidden in the incense burner in Room 18. The chest is trapped with a poisoned needle close to the lock (save vs. Poison or die in one to six melee rounds). In addition to personal possessions, the chest contains:\n\nA silver figurine of Semuanya worth 100 gp;\nA leather bag containing 95 ep;\nA small wooden box, unlocked and untrapped, which holds three vials of holy water and two vials of a potion of Cure Light Wounds (one draught in each); the potion is vile smelling and tasting, but is no less effective for that.\n\nThe wooden carving on the wall is of Semuanya; it has no value. The room is unoccupied.\n\n20. CHIEF SHAMAN'S LIVING QUARTERS\n\nA wooden table is set against the south wall on which is laid a wooden bowl of fruit. There is a wooden bench set against the north wall, while in the centre of the room there is a wooden chair set to face the bench opposite.\n\nUnless the shaman from area 12 has previously alerted them, in which case they will have gone with him, there will be four lizard man shamans in here. Three, seated on the bench, are 2nd level shamans receiving advanced religious instruction from a 5th level shaman seated on the chair.\n\nSee the Appendix for full statistics of the shamans.\n\n21. CHIEF SHAMAN'S SLEEPING QUARTERS\n\nA single cot bed is set against the west wall, an iron chest at its foot. Opposite, against the eastern wall, stands a small wooden table. On it are two items apparently made of silver; one appears to be a statuette of a lizard man, the other an incense burner.\n\nThe latter is lit and gives off a pleasant odour.\n\nFixed with a blob of resinous substance to the underside of the table is the key, which will open the chest in this room.\n\nThe chest is locked and trapped (scything blade, 1-8 hit points of damage). Note that the trap will be sprung unless disarmed, whether the key is used or not. In addition to personal possessions, the chest contains:\n\nA bolt of green velvet cloth, value 30 gp;\nA leather bag containing 500 ep;\nAn ivory figurine of the lizard men's deity, Semuanya, worth five gp;\nInside a small, padded wooden box: two potions of Cure Light Wounds, (grey), two potions of Neutralise Poison (dark green) and one potion of Cure Disease (light red). All these have a vile odour and taste, though they are effective if taken.\n\nThe silver statuette is of Semuanya and is worth 150 gp; the incense burner is worth 20 gp.\n\n22. CAVE OF THE GIANT LIZARDS\n\nRead to the players whichever of the following descriptions is appropriate according to whether their characters approach this cave from the marshes or from the interior of the lizard men's lair. In either case it is assumed that they are using some form of illumination.\n\nIf from the marshes:\n\nA cave entrance 30-feet wide and 15-feet high comes up before you. The marsh turns to glutinous mud as you near the entrance and it is obvious from tracks that large creatures have passed in and out of the cave. Inside the cave the floor is thick mud, and you find it impossible to move at normal speed. There are many tracks of large creatures passing back and forth. The cave reaches a maximum height of some 40 feet. At the far side of the cave is a narrow stone pathway connecting two arched entrances that lead deeper into the hillside, one in the northeast corner of the cave and the other in the south- east corner. It is quite evident that the cave is occupied, as three huge shapes loom up before you\n\nThe occupants are three giant lizards that have been trained as guards by the lizard men. They will attack any intruders immediately. However any adult lizard man present is able to call off the brutes. The giant lizards are too large to enter the corridors leading into the lair. However they can (and will) pass through the cave entrance to pursue party members out into the marshes.\n\nAbout five feet north of the centre of the southern wall, lying only partially buried in the mud, is a breastplate.\n\nIf from the interior of the lair:\n\nYou have entered a huge cave on a narrow stone pathway that runs along the eastern portion of the south wall. The pathway connects two tunnel entrances - one in the southeast corner, the other in the northeast.\n\nAt the far side of the cave is a gaping hole 30 feet wide and 15 feet high that leads apparently into the marshes and the open air.\n\nApart from the stone pathway, the floor is covered with glutinous mud; tracks indicate that some large creatures have passed back and forth. You receive confirmation of this as three huge shapes loom up before you...\n\nNote that the party's movement is slowed to a maximum of 50% normal rate when moving around in the mud which is15 inches deep. However for the occupants of this area neither the mud nor the marshland outside the cave impedes movement. Note also that sounds of melee in this area are likely to be heard in room 23.\n\nThe breastplate is battered and twisted and now detached from the suit of plate mail of which it formed a part, but still recognisable. Vertically below the breastplate there is a short sword buried in the mud. These items were formerly the property of a band of adventurers who tried to penetrate the lair some weeks before, and were killed in the attempt.\n\nThe breastplate is too battered to perform any useful function but the sword is a sword of subtlety. This +1 short sword has a thin, dull grey blade. It adds a +4 bonus to its wielder’s attack roll and damage when making a sneak attack. \n\nGIANT LIZARD, Medium-size Animal\n\nHit Dice\t3d8+9 (23 hit points)\nInitiative\t+2 (Dex)\nSpeed\t30 feet, Swim 30 feet\nAC\t15 (+2 Dex, +3 natural)\nAttacks\tBite +5 melee\nDamage\tBite 1d8+4\nSaves\tFort +6, Ref +5, Will +2\nAbilities\tStr 17, Dex 15, Con 17, Int 2, Wis 12, Cha 2\nSkills\tClimb +9, Hide +7, Listen +4, Move Silently +6, Spot +4\n\n23. GUARD ROOM\n\nThis is a bare storeroom with a wooden bench set against the wall. \n\nThere are three lizard man warriors here. Each of them is armed with two javelins.\n\nThese guards are alert and will hear any combat in area 22 unless appropriate magic is employed. They will appear in that area at the beginning of the second melee round, discharge their missiles at the party then close for hand to hand combat, joining in with the giant lizards. They have normal movement rate in the mud.\n\n24. FEMALE QUARTERS\n\nThere is a bustle of activity in this room and it is fairly noisy. Your first impression is that this is a large nursery - there are lizard man females and infants scattered around the area in small groups, the children playing or sleeping, the females gossiping, drinking, oiling their bodies, comparing their jewellery and so forth.\n\nThere is a lot of furniture in here - straw mattresses scattered around the floor; wooden tables carrying earthenware cups, mugs and pitchers, clay bowls in which wild flowers are planted; chairs set beside the tables, wooden stools here and there; wooden chests - some with their lids open - by each of the mattresses.\nAll in all this seems quite a pleasant domestic scene.\n\nThere are 20 lizard man females and 13 infants in the area.\n\nUnless they have previously been encountered as wanderers, three of the females will be approaching the east door, intent on leaving it on some errand, as the party arrives. If present, they will notice the party immediately and alert the others. Otherwise, the party's arrival is unlikely (five per cent chance) to be noticed immediately because of the general hubbub, but their presence will certainly be detected if they move into the room as opposed to remaining in the doorway.\n\nEven when their intrusion is noticed the party will not be greeted with hostility unless they take offensive action. The females will, of course, defend their children and property and will do their utmost to prevent the party from entering area 25. If a fight breaks out, two or three females will attempt to escape through the east door and find some guards to come to their aid, while their colleagues do their best in the melee.\n\nIf the party should leave without taking action other than observation, the females will not pursue them into the corridor and the three about to set off on their errand (if present) will delay their departure until they reason it would be safe to do so. However should the party take other action - fighting, looting or even just threatening - and females remain alive when the party leaves, some of these females will remain to protect the infants while others try to sneak undetected to a guard post and alert the lizard man warriors there.\n\nThe wooden chests are all unlocked and untrapped. Each contains a miscellany of worthless items - assorted leather belts, straps, bundles of coloured cloth and various bracelets, brooches, bangles and beads. These items are flashy but valueless. Note that there are no rings. In addition (roll dice to determine) every fifth chest contains a purse holding 2-12 sp and every ninth chest will contain a flask of oil. One chest (select at random from the 35 chests there) also contains the only finger ring present among the other jewellery; this is a magical Ring of Feather Falling. It had belonged to the magician member of the party wiped out earlier in the lair; the lizard man warrior who slew him took the ring and gave it to a female with which to win her favour and she has kept it since, in total ignorance of its magical properties.\n\n25. HATCHERY\n\nIt is discernibly warmer here. A slightly fetid odour - not overpowering but unmistakable - wafts in your direction as you open the door. The floor of the room is mud; smooth and unbroken save near the door where three tiny reptilian shapes are crawling amongst what look like egg fragments.\n\nThere are about 200 lizard man eggs buried in the mud in this room. Three, just near the door, have hatched very recently and the infants are newborn. Any blow will kill these infants - even picking them up incautiously could do them considerable harm.\n\nThere is nothing of value here.\n\n26. TREASURE ROOM\n\nNote that the only access to this room is via a secret door that is clearly visible to the occupants of area 27, in addition to which any character reaching the secret door must have somehow dealt with the gate (see area 27). Note too the trap which is immediately inside the door - 10 feet square of flooring which will tilt on an axis through its hinged north edge if weight in excess of 25 lbs is placed on it. Below the trap is a 12 feet deep pit in which are five venomous snakes. Characters falling into the pit will take normal falling damage and be attacked by the snakes. These creatures are five feet long. \n\nMEDIUM-SIZED VIPER, Medium-Sized Animal \n\nHit Dice\t2d8 (10 hit points)\nInitiative\t+3 (Dex)\nSpeed\t20 feet, Climb 20 feet, Swim 20 feet\nAC\t16 (+3 Dex, +3 natural)\nAttacks\tBite +4 melee\nDamage\tBite 1d4-1 and poison\nSpecial Attacks\tPoison\nSpecial Qualities\tScent\nSaves\tFort +2, Ref +6, Will +1\nAbilities\tStr 8, Dex 17, Con 11, Int 1, Wis 12, Cha 2\nSkills\tBalance +11, Climb +11, Hide +12, Listen +9, Spot +9\nFeats\tWeapon Finesse (bite)\nNotes:\tPoison: Fortitude save (DC 11). Initial damage 1d6 points Constitution, Secondary \n\tdamage 1d6 points Constitution.\n\tScent: Snakes can scent their prey. They detect creatures within 30 feet and can discern their direction as a partial action.\n\nFirst, describe the area as seen when characters open the door, assuming they are using some form of illumination:\n\nA narrow 10-foot square entrance widens out to the east to form a room 20-feet wide and 40-feet long. At the far end there appear to be some sacks and what looks like a large chest.\n\nThen deal with the trap - its disarming etc. if it is detected and the characters' fate if it is not. When the characters are able to see the room more clearly, give them this description:\n\nYour earlier suspicions are confirmed. There are four large sacks and an iron chest that carries a large hasp and closed padlock. The remainder of the room is bare.\n\nThis is the chief's personal treasure. The sacks each contain 2,000 sp. The chest is locked (the key is hidden under the throne in area 11). \n\nThe chest contains:\n\n2,000 ep\nA gold crown in the shape of a coiled serpent with emerald eyes, worth 1000 gp\nA gold-bonded ivory sceptre, worth 1000 gp\nA gold collar set with emeralds, worth 2000 gp\n\n27. GUARD ROOM\n\nThis is a bare room with a wooden bench set against the east wall.\n\nNote the iron gate, which blocks off the corridor to the south of this room. The gate is made in two equal halves hinged at the walls and reaching from floor to ceiling. The vertical bars are three inches apart and there are five horizontal struts equally spaced along the vertical dimension. Normally the gate is barred and closed from the north side by two stout bars carried in brackets about five feet and seven feet above the floor respectively.\n\nThere are three lizard man warriors here, each armed with a morning star and small shield.\n\nThe guards have been ordered to keep the gate barred at all times when it is not in use, but they are no more perfect than other guards so there is a 20% chance that they have been careless, in which case the party will find the gates standing open. One guard is always on watch and he stands in the northwest corner of the room, to see as far down the corridor as possible.\n\nIf the gates are closed, read to the players the description of area 41 (where there are identical gates) modifying the compass directions as necessary. If they are open, give an appropriately modified description.\n\nWhether the gates are open or closed the guard in this area is alert and will see and hear party members as soon as they round the angle of the corridor unless appropriate magic and/or abilities are used. Conversely the leading character has only a 50% chance of detecting the guard's presence.\n\nThe actions of the guards will depend on what the intruders do - one guard will keep a covert watch on their activities as soon as they are detected. If the party heads direct for the guardroom itself the guards will attempt to ambush them. If the party goes directly to the treasure room then the guards will immediately leap to the attack, achieving surprise five chances in six hoping to push characters into the trap in area 26.\n\n28. OFFICER'S QUARTERS\n\nThere is a plain, wooden table and a wooden chair set against the south wall; on the table is a wooden bowl and a single bed is set against the east wall with a wooden chest at its foot.\n\nThe chest is unlocked and untrapped. It contains personal possessions, a dagger in a scabbard and a purse with 25 ep. This is a large barracks area. About two dozen straw mattresses are set around the floor, each with a wooden chest at its foot. At the south end of the room a long table is set centrally, wooden benches to either side of it. There is a rather mustier, unkempt air about the place than elsewhere.\n\nUnless some have already been encountered as wanderers, there will be 12 lizard men warriors in this room. Four are seated at the table talking and cleaning their weapons, while the others (the ones which could already have been encountered elsewhere in the lair) are forming up under the command of an officer preparatory to going out on patrol.\n\nThe warriors at the table are armed with broadswords and shields, as are five of the patrol group. The other three of the patrol group a re armed with two javelins each and one of these wears round his neck a fine silver chain carrying an ivory plaque, value 3 gp. The officer is armed with a broadsword and carries a medium-sized shield. Around his neck is a silver collar, value 15 gp. The chests (there are 22) are all unlocked and untrapped. Each contains personal possessions. In addition the following items will be found in the chests (place them at random):\n\nIn five of the chests, a purse containing 2-8 sp;\nA necklace of seashells (no value);\nA pewter mug (no value);\nA lump of pink coral (value 10 gp);\nA leather bag containing five irregularly shaped coloured stones (no value).\n\n29. BARRACKS\n\n30. SUB-CHIEF'S LIVING QUARTERS\n\nPleasant living quarters; though the furnishings are spartan, they are of reasonably good quality. A wooden table stands in the centre of the room with four chairs around it. On the table is a bowl containing nuts. In the southeast corner stands a small, closed cask on which stand an unlit lantern and a goblet.\n\nThe bowl is of pure electrum and is worth 200 gp. The cask contains wine - quite reasonable to the human palate. The goblet is of silver and is worth 50 gp while the lantern is of the normal hooded type.\n\n31. SUB-CHIEF'S SLEEPING QUARTERS\n\nA single cot is set against the east wall. Beneath it there is what seems to be a lion's skin. In the south west corner of the room there is a brass-bound wooden chest, its lid closed and secured with a heavy metal padlock.\n\nConcealed by the lion's skin under the bed is an iron chest, the key to which is in the sub-chief's pocket (see area 40). The chest is trapped and the trap will be sprung even if the key is used unless previously detected and disarmed. Setting off the trap releases a cloud of gas that fills the entire room in a single round. (Poison gas; Fortitude save (DC 13); Initial damage: slowed (as per spell); Secondary damage: paralysis for 2-8 turns.)\n \nThis chest contains five leather belts and straps having electrum buckles and set with pearls (value 100 gp each), an electrum armband (value 150 gp), a leather bag containing 50 sp and a prismatic kaleidoscope (an interesting artefact which is valueless to the party but of great value to the sub-chief, who regards it as a magical item and will fight bitterly to keep it).\n\n32. GUARD ROOM\n\nThe guards in this area are alert and will be aware of the party's approach (unless magical means, for instance, conceal that approach) as soon as the party enters the north-east/south- west passage segment.\n\nAs you turn the bend you see that the corridor branches into a room. This area appears bare of furniture except for a wooden bench set against the east wall.\n\nYou immediately encounter five lizard men, apparently guards.\n\nThere are five lizard man warriors constantly on guard here. These guards are each armed with a broadsword and a small shield.\n\nThe guards will immediately challenge any approaching party. They have been selected especially to guard the approach to their chief's quarters and are much less susceptible to bribery and smooth talk than any of their colleagues. The party will have to present a very convincing story indeed if they are to be allowed unmolested access to area 33 and beyond, otherwise they will be required to leave the area immediately.\n\n33. CHIEF'S LIVING QUARTERS\n\nThough hardly sumptuous, this room is much more comfortably furnished than any you have seen previously within the lair. In the centre of the room is a circular table of polished wood with four chairs set around it. On the table are three items apparently made of silver, and certainly very decorative - a platter carrying fruit, a carafe and a goblet.\n\nIn the southeast corner is an armchair that has been crudely, but seemingly comfortably, upholstered.\n\nThe items on the table are of silver. The platter and the carafe are worth 1 00 gp each while the goblet is worth 50 gp. All three are eng raved with a simple pictograph showing an erect lizard with a forked tongue extended (cf. the appearance of this device in module U1 - SEA GHOST).\n\n34. CHIEF'S SLEEPING QUARTERS\n\nObviously the sleeping quarters for a high-ranking lizard man. There is a large ornate bed set with its head to the centre of the south wall; on it are scattered some rugs and crude cushions. Next to the bed on the east side is a small table on which is set a crudely framed drawing of a lizard man female.\n\nIn the southeast corner is an iron chest, closed and padlocked. Next to it is a large wooden cupboard.\n\nThe iron chest is locked (the key is in the chief's pouch - see area 40) and trapped with a needle. Anyone opening the chest will be jabbed by the needle but will not suffer damage. (The DM may wish to play on this, since the needle is discoloured, by asking the player to make a saving throw and, if this fails, continuing play as if the effects have yet to be noticed. In other words the DM should not in any way state that the needle is poisoned, but if the players make that assumption he should not correct them.) The chest contains:\n\nSix sets of leather straps and belts with gold buckles and set with pearls, value 100 gp each set;\nA gold-banded, gem-studded dagger and scabbard, value 250 gp;\nA leather bag containing 100 gp;\nA flask of perfumed oil, value 50 gp;\nA jade figurine of Semuanya, value 100 gp.\n\nNote the secret trapdoor (detect as secret door) in the southwest corner. This gives access to a tunnel that leads to area 11 (see the description of that area).\n\nThe cupboard contains only one item - a fine brocade robe in a rich red cloth decorated with gold thread. This item is worth 300 gp and is especially valued by the chief; it is in effect his robe of office.\n\n35. HAREM\n\nThere are two single beds in this room, both against the east wall; at the foot of each is a brassbound wooden chest. Against the south wall is placed a brocade upholstered couch and hanging from the wall above this is a large glass mirror in a wooden frame.\n\nIn the centre of the room is a circular table of polished wood with wooden chairs set to either side. On it is a square gaming board (with alternating black and white squares, like a chess board), a silver bowl containing fruit, a decanter and two goblets.\n\nUnless extreme circumstances prevail leg. the guards in area 32 have beaten a fighting retreat here) there will be two lizard man females in here playing a game at the table and drinking a light red wine (quite pleasant) from the goblets. One wears an electrum necklace set with coral, value 250 gp. The other wears a gold bracelet set with pearls, value 300 gp.\n\nIt is extremely unlikely that these females will fight. In most circumstances they will attempt to flee to take refuge in the pool in area 36. They will fight, however, if they are cornered and have no option or if they see the intruding party attempting to enter area 37.\n\nThe chests are both unlocked and untrapped. Their contents are:\n\nIn one chest:\n\nFour leather belt/strap sets with silver buckles and set with coral, value 20 gp per set;\nA flask of perfumed oil, value 50 gp;\nA silk scarf, value 5 gp;\nA purse containing 150 ep.\n\nIn the second chest:\n\nThree leather belt/strap sets, as above;\nA silver mirror, value 20 gp;\nA flask of perfumed oil, value 50 gp;\nA bolt of velvet cloth, value 30 gp;\nA purse containing 50 ep.\n\nThe bowl, decanter and goblets are all silver and are worth 50 gp, 50 gp and 10 gp each respectively.\n\n36. RECREATION ROOM\n\nA bare stone-flagged room. Filling the central area is a 20-feet square pool of what looks like clear water. The floor of the pool appears to be tiered to provide easy access so that anyone descending into the pool can do so down what amounts to a series of steps each two feet six inches high.\n\nThere appears to be nothing else in here.\n\nThe pool is of clear, warm water though it is not possible for the characters to see the bottom at the centre where the water is 15 feet deep. It is at the bottom of the pool that the females will be hiding if they have fled from area 35.\n\nThis is simply a recreation area for the chief and his females; there is nothing of value here.\n\n37. THE ROYAL HATCHERY\n\nIt is discernibly warmer in here. The walls and ceiling of the room are unremarkable but the floor is covered with mud.\n\nThe warm mud covering the floor is six inches deep. Embedded in the mud are 12 lizard man eggs (not visible above the surface). These are the chief's females' eggs and are, naturally enough, very valuable to him. The DM should recognize the possibility that the party will be able to use the eggs as tools for coercion - for instance in negotiations about wergild.\n\n38. LIZARD MAN MINISTER'S QUARTERS\n\nA small comfortable room. In the centre is a circular wooden table on which lies a closed book. To one side of the table is an armchair, crudely upholstered; to the other side is a plain wooden chair. In the northwest corner there is a brass tripod supporting a brass bowl that is filled with hot coals. The room is warm and smoky.\n\nSeated in the armchair reading a papyrus scroll is an aged lizard man. He wears a large gold chain (value 1,000 gp) around his neck. This is the minister, the chief's leading councillor and by far the most intelligent lizard man in the lair. He is, for a lizard man, extremely wise and it is due to his inspiration that the strategy of forging the multi-racial alliance against the sahuagin was devised. He has arranged for the exchange of emissaries and for the purchase of the weaponry brought on the SEA GHOST (see module U1).\n\nHis appearance betrays his age. His teeth and claws are stained and blunted, his eyesight is fading and his senses of hearing and smell have lost their acuity. If an intruding party approaches his door reasonably quietly and manage to open it on the first attempt, they will gain automatic surprise.\n\nThe minister will not fight even in self-defence. His first reaction to intrusion, assuming he is not immediately attacked, will be one of mild surprise, asking the intruders who they are, where they have come from, who has sent them, and so forth. He knows they are not ambassadors for he has made no arrangements with humans, but nevertheless will be quite amiable and prepared to talk.\n\nIn any talks, however, the minister will first of all find out whether or not the party members are in any way allied with sahuagin and his subsequent conversation and action will depend almost entirely on what response, if any, he elicits.\n\nThus, if he is entirely satisfied that the characters are not in league with the sahuagin, he will give them information about the alliance and the impending attack on the sahuagin lair. Further, he will offer to arrange a meeting between the characters and the lizard man chief with the express purpose of bringing humans into the alliance.\n\nOn the other hand if the characters are non-committal about their relationships with sahuagin (or if, for some strange reason, the characters pretend they are friendly with sahuagin) the minister will make no mention of the alliance or the impending assault. Instead he will make every effort and use any silver-tongued excuse to slip away, going directly to the drill hall (area 40) to warn the chief of the presence of intruders. In this event the chief will immediately implement measures to hunt down and kill or capture the party; all guard posts and barracks will go on alert and their occupants will be impossible to surprise, while the chances of a random encounter in the lair increase to one chance in six, checking each turn.\n\nNote the status of the minister and his relationships with others in the lair (in particular see the section LIZARD MEN - POLITICAL STRUCTURE). The shamans in the lair hate and distrust this old lizard man whose policies, in their opinion, flout the sacred teachings and doctrines of their god Semuanya. They would be pleased to see him discredited and delighted to see him dead but dare not take any overt action against him yet, as the chief trusts him completely and the sub-chief stands in awe of him.\n\nIf the papyrus scroll the old lizard man minister is reading is perused by party members, they will find that it is written in the common language and is from the local locathah chief to the lizard man chief; it accredits those locathah currently present in the lair as his ambassadors, authorising them to act fully on his behalf in all matters pertaining to the alliance. It is expressed in general terms only and gives no specifics regarding the nature of the alliance nor those against whom the alliance is directed; nowhere in it is the word \"sahuagin\" present.\n\nThe book on the table is written in the common tongue and entitled 'Power Politics' by Abel Mackle. It can be sold for 5 gp and is mainly about the trickier and more devious side of political life.\n\n39. LIZARD MAN MINISTER'S SLEEPING QUARTERS\n\nA single bed is set against the east wall. A small wooden bookcase containing five books stands against the south wall; beside it is an old leather chair. Against the west wall of the room there is an iron chest, a closed padlock in the hasp. On top of the lid is a single glove. Next to the bed stands a tall cupboard, its door partially open. It appears to be empty.\n\nThe cupboard contains a single, large maroon robe - obviously old but well cared for. The minister wears this on official occasions as a badge of office; it has no special properties.\n\nThe books are all written in the common tongue:\n\n\"The Politics of Power\" - Lorenzo Domici. Another rather arcane work dealing with the shiftier side of politics and saleable for 5 gp.\n\n\"The Triumph of Diplomacy\" - Tyrons Scroot. A history of the author's successes in the diplomatic field, saleable for 5 gp.\n\n\"The Occult Properties of Gemstones\" - Mage Tenser. This book is another of Tenser's tomes on his favourite subject (wealth!) and follows on from his first book \"The Magical Properties of Gemstones\" (see Module U1 -The Sinister Secret of Saltmarsh; the Haunted House, room 2). If the players want their characters to read this book and demand to know something of its contents, the Dungeon Master's imagination may be stretched! However, reading the book will convey no special advantage to the characters and most of the contents will be too obscure for comprehension.\n\n\"A Lizard Language and Common Tongue Grammar': This book is written by an anonymous author, although the introduction describes him as a druid. Intensive study of this book by a character of intelligence 11 or more for six months will enable that character to learn the lizard man tongue (less than intensive study will require a longer period, DM's discretion). The book is saleable for 10 gp.\n\n\"The Nature of the Sahuagin\" - Professor Gax. This slim volume contains a detailed account of the nature of sahuagin. If players want their characters to read it and demand to know something of its contents, read out those passages dealing with the sahuagin in the Monster Manual, omitting only technical details such as armour class, hit dice, etc., and inform the players that the rest is all in the same vein. The book can be sold for 15 gp.\n\nThe glove on top of the chest is of leather; anyone examining it even casually will notice that the fingers are slightly discoloured. The chest, though locked, is untrapped. The key to the padlock is stuck to the rear vertical surface of the chest, affixed by a blob of some resinous substance. The key has been smeared with a contact poison (Sassone leaf residue; Fortitude save (DC 16); Initial damage 2d12 hit points; Secondary damage 1d6 temporary Constitution). The first person to handle the key will take full effect of the poison; the handling will wipe most of the poison off the key so the second person to handle it will take reduced effect (Fortitude save DC 12) and by the time a third person handles the key the poison can be assumed to have been wiped off completely. Naturally if a glove is used to handle the key, the wearer suffers no effect from the poison, and an astute player may realise why the lizard minister keeps an odd glove nearby.\n\nThe chest contains personal possessions and:\n\nA leather bag containing 500 ep;\nA flask of perfumed oil (value 50 gp);\nA velvet bag containing five pearls;\nA small pot of contact poison (there is enough here to smear the key at least 30 times).\n\nFour of the pearls are quite normal and have values 75 gp, 100 gp, 150 gp, and 200 gp. The fifth - identical in appearance to the 75 gp pearl is a Pearl of Wisdom. The pearl increases the wearer’s Wisdom score in the form of a +2 bonus. Note that only the lizard minister knows the powers of this item. He has not divulged his secret even to the chief.\n\n40. DRILL HALL\n\nNote that the DM will have to make slight variations in the description that follows, depending on which door the party uses to enter this area. Note also that the activities taking place here are noisy and can easily be heard in adjacent corridors.\n\nThis is quite a large open area; six floor-to-ceiling pillars demarcate a central area, which is completely bare of furniture. In this central area the earth floor has been packed closer than elsewhere, as if by the passage of many feet. Several wooden benches stand near the north and south walls.\n\nWhat appears to be a large mattress has been fixed to the centre of the east wall of the room. Attached in some way to this is a large humanoid creature - strangely immobile despite the fact that four lizard men are hurling javelins at it from the approximate centre of the area. Apparently supervising this activity, a fifth lizard man stands nearby shouting commands.\n\nAt the near end of the open central area four more lizard men are apparently fighting, two against two; they are armed with swords and carry shields.\n\nObserving this activity, two lizard men (from their appearance, high ranking officers) are standing to one side, near the central northern pillar.\n\nThe two groups of lizard men each comprise four warriors; the one supervising the javelin throwing is an officer and the other two are the chief and sub-chief respectively. The javelin throwers are armed with two javelins each and carry no shield while the other four are armed with broadswords and carry shields. \n\nThe officer is armed with broadsword, carries a shield and wears a silver collar (value 15 gp) round his neck. The sub chief is armed with a broadsword and carries a shield. The electrum collar round his neck is worth 100 gp and the silver armband on his left forearm is worth 75 gp. He wears a belt pouch containing the key to his iron treasure chest (see room 31). The chief is armed with a broadsword and carries a large shield. The gold collar round his neck and the gold armband on his left forearm are worth 300 gp each. The key to his iron chest (in room 34) is in his belt pouch.\n\nThe mattress is a rectangular straw stuffed target fastened to the wall. Over it has been stretched the flayed hide and head of a sahuagin (first impressions may lead the observers to believe this to be human) which the javelin-throwers are using as a target. The DM should not reveal to the players that the hide is of a sahuagin (unless the characters have previously encountered and identified one of these creatures), only giving vague information about its general shape, size, colouration and so forth. However if Oceanus is with the party he will recognize it instantly and identify it to the others, if asked.\n\nThe other four lizard men are merely practising their swordplay (as the characters will recognise if they are able to observe for a while without themselves being observed). It will be clear that the lizard men are not very skilled in this activity.\n\nAll these creatures will attack any party members who they see intruding into this area and will pursue them if they flee. However if the party appear to be overcoming the occupants of this area, then the chief will try to escape by running to the nearest barracks and returning with reinforcements as soon as possible. If the party ref rain from attack and call out to the chief for a parley, he will agree and hold h is own warriors back while entering into negotiations with the party. (He will do this wherever he may meet the party if they first call out to him for parley).\n\nIf the chief and sub-chief have been slain or captured as wanderers, then they will not be present in this area.\n\n41. IRON GATES\n\nAn iron gate bars your way. It is constructed in two approximately equal parts, reaching from floor to ceiling. The vertical bars are about three inches apart and there are five horizontal struts spaced along the vertical dimension. Two stout iron bars carried in brackets about five feet and seven feet respectively above the floor bar the gates on the western most side.\n\nThese points represent the ends of the patrolled area in the western part of the lair. If any occupant of the lair wishes to pass westward through these gates he/she normally has to wait for a patrol to appear to unbar the gates (though no password is demanded unless special security measures are in force and the patrol will always unbar the gate if the request is made by a lizard man). Any lizard man wishing to pass into the eastern part of the lair will be accompanied to the gate by a patrol and the gate will be barred again afterwards.\n\nNote the relatively short, but quite steep, flight of steps leading down on the eastern side of each gate.\n\n42. GUARD POST\n\nThere is a very solid-looking ironbound wooden door in the southwest corner of this area. Next to it, set against the south wall, is a rough wooden bench.\n\nThree lizard man warriors are on guard here, armed with two javelins apiece. One of them carries a bunch of six keys at his belt. These are the keys to the five calls in area 43 and to the door leading to that area.\n\nThe door at the rear of the area is locked - a keyhole is clearly visible midway up one side.\n\nThe occupants of area 44 will not hear noise of melee in this area, but if one of the guards gets a chance to escape he will try to get to area 44 and call reinforcements.\n\nIf questioned and under duress, the guards will inform the characters of the cells and their contents.\n\n43. CELLS\n\nYou have descended a short flight of steep, rough steps and are now in a narrow east-west passage ending in a blank wall some 60 feet away. To your right are five solid looking ironbound doors; all are closed. The doors have no exterior features such as handles but each has a keyhole midway up its left side.\n\nThe keys to these doors are in the possession of one of the guards in area 42. Note that there are no spy-holes of any sort though there are key holes; additionally the doors are of very stout construction - communication through a closed door will at best be very muffled and it will be difficult to carry on more than a very fragmentary conversation between, for example, any prisoner and a would-be rescuer. Without being unfair to the players, the DM should take advantage of this fact if characters attempt to communicate with the occupant of a cell.\n\n43A. WATER CELL\n\nIf a character uses brute force to open this door it will be impossible to avoid plunging into the water. If it is unlocked with the correct key, however, the character will not fall in the water unless a roll of d20 exceeds that character's dexterity score. Of course if the door opener is aware what lies beyond the door leg there is no chance of falling in if the key is used.\n\nWhere you would expect to see a floor there is a water surface. Opposite you, on the south wall and some three to four feet below the surface of the water there is a hole about two feet in diameter which has been covered with a metal grille.\n\nThough the water is not particularly clear, you can see a shape swimming around some distance below the surface.\n\nAbove water the cell is completely bare.\n\nNote that there is no sill by the door inside the room. The hole on the south wall opens out into a roughly circular horizontal tunnel that connects to area 52 (at which point there is another grille). Both grilles are set firmly into the rock wall. The cell water is thus seawater and tidal. At high water, the water level is about three inches below the level of the floor in the passage, and the water is some 20 feet deep.\n\nImprisoned in here (and, in normal circumstances, at the bottom of the pool) is a sahuagin warrior. This creature speaks common and is extremely cunning and subtle. It will tell party members, if they do not recognize it, that it is a triton held captive by the evil lizard men, and it will offer to assist the party against their \"mutual enemies\" in exchange for its liberty. Even if the party correctly identify it, it will still try to persuade them to take it along with them, offering assistance against the lizard men in exchange for its liberty. It will be very persuasive in its arguments, not hesitating to lie with regard to its strengths and abilities in order to enhance its own potential as a possible ally. If the party accept its offer it will, however, desert them at the first opportunity that presents itself, returning to its tribe to advise it of the lizard men's whereabouts and their plans, though while still with the party it will fight any creature encounter with an unbelievable ferocity.\n\nWhile the sahuagin is with the party there is absolutely no chance at all of them entering into any agreement or alliance with the lizard men or any of the other races present in their lair; for these, seeing the sahuagin with the party, will conclude that the party members have allied with the creature and his kind on a permanent basis and that they are friendly with that race. Hence they will treat the party with implacable hostility not only as enemies but perhaps as renegades as well. Even when the sahuagin departs or is slain, the lizard men and their allies will be most suspicious of the party and their motives as a consequence of their association with the creature, and attempts to arrive at an understanding and an alliance will be much more difficult.\n\nShould the party decline the sahuagin's offer of an alliance, it will then attack them and try to force its way past them to escape via the sea cave in area 49. It has no weapons or treasure.\n\nOceanus the aquatic elf will recognise the sahuagin on sight and will immediately identify it for the party; other party members will not recognise the creature unless they have previously encountered and identified a sahuagin (or perhaps the guards in area 42 have told them). Oceanus will also advise strongly against allying with it and oppose accepting its assistance. If the rest of the party should overrule him in this matter he will attempt to kill the sahuagin then and there.\n\nSAHUAGIN, Medium-Size Humanoid (Aquatic) \n\nHit Dice\t2d8+2 (14 hit points)\nInitiative\t+1 (Dex)\nSpeed\t30 feet, Swim 60 feet\nAC\t16 (+1 Dex, +5 natural)\nAttacks\t2 Rakes +1 melee, Bite +1 melee or 2 Rakes +3 melee, 2 Claws +1 melee\nDamage\tRake 1d4+2, Claw 1d2+1, Bite 1d4+1\nSpecial Attacks\tBlood Frenzy\nSpecial Qualities\tSpeak with sharks, Underwater sense, Light blindness, Freshwater sensitivity\nSaves\tFort +4, Ref +1, Will +1\nAbilities\tStr 14, Dex 13, Con 12, Int 14, Wis 13, Cha 9\nSkills\tAnimal Empathy +2, Hide +6, Listen +7, Profession (hunt) +2, Spot +7\n\tWilderness Lore +1.

It gains +2 Constitution and +2 Strength and suffers a -2 AC penalty. \n\tSpeak with sharks: Sahuagin can communicate telepathically with sharks up to 150 feet away. The communication is limited to simple concepts.\n\tUnderwater sense: A sahuagin can locate creatures underwater within a 30 feet radius. This ability negates the benefits of invisibility and makes the sahuagin immune to figments while underwater.\n\tLight blindness: Abrupt exposure to bright light blinds a sahuagin for 1 round. It suffers a -1 morale penalty to attacks, saves and checks while in bright light.\n\tFreshwater sensitivity: A sahuagin fully immersed in freshwater must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC 15) or leave the water immediately. If it cannot escape it suffers a -4 morale penalty to all attacks, saves and checks.  \n\n43B. WATER CELL\n\nThis cell is the same as cell A except that it is unoccupied. It is fed by a similar tunnel leading to area 52, with a grille at each end. Use the description for cell A, omitting mention of the \"swimming shape\".\n\n43C, 43D. CELL\n\nThis appears to be a prison cell, bare and unoccupied.\n\nThis is indeed a normally dry cell, no one being in residence at the moment.\n\n43E. CELL\n\nThis appears to be a prison cell in which a lizard man is being held. There is no furniture in here - just the prisoner.\n\nThe lizard man is a warrior, imprisoned for a few days for an infringement of disciplinary rules.\n\nIf the party enters this cell without the sahuagin being with them, then the lizard man will simply huddle back into the furthest corner of his cell, hissing in a menacing manner, but he will not attack unless attacked first. However, if the sahuagin is present with the party, then the lizard man will attack it immediately and ferociously, ignoring the party members completely. The sahuagin will, of course, defend itself, but should the lizard man succeed in killing it, he will then try to flee to area 44 to rouse and warn the occupants there of intruders.\n\nIn the event of sahuagin/lizard man combat here, Oceanus will, if he is able, attempt to join in and help the lizard man. If by any chance the characters should aid the sahuagin in fighting the lizard man, that act will mark the end of the party's relationship with Oceanus. Thereafter he will be unhelpful and, when circumstances permit, openly hostile to the characters. (If a player has been running Oceanus so far, the DM should take over that task from here on.)\n\n44. BARRACKS\n\nIn the centre of the room is a plain wooden table with two wooden benches set beside it; around the room against the walls are 11 straw mattresses with a wooden chest beside each.\n\nUnless they have been called away for some reason there will be three lizard man warriors in here, seated at the table and playing a game with a set of crude wooden dice. Note however that they will not hear melee in area 42.\n\nIf the warriors are able to do so, they will fight with their morning stars and defend themselves with small shields, these items having been laid to one side during the game. Otherwise they will fight with claws and fangs.\n\nOne of the warriors wears around his neck a fine silver chain carrying an ivory plaque. This item can be sold for 3 gp.\n\nOn the table there are small stacks of coins - gaming stakes - totalling 5 ep, 12 sp, and 9 cp.\n\nThe chests are all unlocked and untrapped. Each contains an assortment of leather belts and straps and a small bundle of coloured cloths. There are other items in some of the chests - determine at random in which chest they can be found:\n\nin each of four chests, a purse containing 2-8 sp;\nin each of three chests, a flask of oil;\na bag of sea shells (no value);\na solid quartz sphere, quite transparent and about four inches in diameter (no value to the party but very precious to its owner);\na dagger in a scabbard.\n\n45, 46. OFFICERS' QUARTERS\n\nThese rooms are very similar - the following description will serve for each, though the positions of the items of furniture can be varied if so desired.\n\nA plain wooden table and two wooden chairs stand near the wall furthest from the door. To one side of the room is a single bed - little more than a rough mattress set on a crude wooden frame. At the foot of the bed is a wooden chest.\n\nTo add some decoration, place on the tables:\n\n(in Room 45) a wooden dish containing fruit and nuts\n(in Room 46) a ceramic pitcher half full of coarse ale and a ceramic mug.\n\nEach chest is unlocked and untrapped and contains personal possessions. In addition:\n\n(in Room 45) a purse containing 20 sp and a dagger in a scabbard\n(in Room 46) a purse containing 15 sp and a hunk of raw amber, value 75 gp.\n\n47. LUMBER ROOM\n\nNote that this room is normally dark; the description assumes that the characters have a source of light in use.\n\nThis appears to be a room used for storing worthless junk. From the door you can see broken, rusty weapons, rotted leather straps, dirty and torn cloths of various colours, pieces of wood which may once have been items of furniture and a few twisted pieces of metal which once were perhaps iron gates. The room smells of mould and decay.\n\nIn the south west corner of the room, lying amid a heap of mouldy sacks and rags, is the huddled body of a dead elf thief. His padded armour is slashed and torn and his hand still clutches a broken short sword.\n\nHe will not be seen until a party member approaches within 10 feet of his corpse due to the sacks and rags covering him.\n\nThis thief was a member of the band of adventurers who attempted to raid this lair earlier. When his comrades were slain he, though mortally wounded, managed to break free from the fight and fled to this area where he subsequently expired and has remained since, undiscovered. In his belt pouch are 5 gp and 11 sp, a topaz worth 75 gp and a scrap of paper on which is written in common the word 'Boorabap'. In his back pack are some mouldy rations, five rusty iron spikes and a set of thief's picks and tools. Beneath his body is a six-inch long ivory stick, about one quarter of an inch in diameter; this is a Wand of Knock with 25 charges (treat as a Knock spell cast by a 7th level mage). It will be for the party to deduce that \"Boorabap' is the command word for this item.\n\n48. GUARD POST\n\nA wooden bench is set along the south wall of this area that is otherwise bare of furniture.\n\nUnless they have been called away for some reason there will be three lizard man warriors here. Each warrior is armed with a morning star and carries a small shield.\n\nNote that these guards will hear any melee in area 52. If this happens, two of them will go immediately to that area while the third goes to area 44 to summon reinforcements.\n\n49. GUARD POOL\n\nThis is a deep pool of sea water, which is fed directly from the sea via a short tunnel. The water is reasonably clear, but the bottom is covered with seaweed that grows to a height of five feet or so. There is a stone pathway, 10-feet wide and three feet above the high-water mark, running along the southern edge of this area; a flight of stone steps, 10 feet wide, leads down from this pathway to descend into the water. Apart from the pathway and steps the rest of this area is a natural cavern formed of rock.\n\nThe pool varies in depth from 15 feet to 25 feet and the passage leading in from the sea is about 15 feet wide. The height of the cavern is 25 feet above the high water mark at the centre. There is a wide passage connecting this area with area 50; the roof here is only five feet or so above the high water level so anyone walking along the stone pathway will have to crawl at this point. Similarly, the roof in the sea-bound passage is about five feet above high water level. The following general description and those of areas 50, 51 and 52 will require amplification, depending on the direction of the party's approach and the height of the tide.\n\nThis is a large sea-cave, roughly circular and about 70 feet in diameter. It connects to the sea via a passage, perhaps 15 feet across at its widest point, whose roof is at most five feet above the highest sea-level. It also connects to what is presumably another cave via a 30 feet wide passage in the south-east corner, and again the roof is only five feet above high-water there.\n\nThe main cave has a high roof - for most of its span perhaps 25 feet above the high-water mark.\n\nMost of the cave appears natural, but a rough ledge has been cut into the rock running along the southern edge and probably connecting with an adjacent cave. At the western extremity of this pathway, an opening has been cut into the rock wall to permit access to a passage beyond. Near to this, a flight of rough stone steps leads down into the water. The water is quite clear but the bottom of the pool is covered with seaweed, its fronds swaying lazily to and fro.\n\nThere are four lizard man warriors in the pool, near the sea cave entrance, guarding this area. They will not be seen by party members as they enter this area because they are concealed in the seaweed, but they will see party members without difficulty. Each warrior carries a spear and has a dagger in this belt. This is the point at which the lizard men most fear an attack by sahuagin so the guards are alert and have been rigorously drilled in a defensive procedure in the event of intrusion from the sea. This procedure comprises:\n\none guard swims to the steps and goes to alert the occupants of areas 42, 44, 45, 46 and 48, returning with them as quickly as possible;\na second guard swims successively to area 50 to alert the koalinth, to area 51 to alert the locathah and to area 52 to alert the mermen. Each of these groups of creatures will immediately swim to area 49 to fight the intruders;\nthe other two guards remain hidden in the seaweed, hoping to find an opportunity to attack the intruders from the rear.\n\nIf the characters approach the lair from the sea, therefore, they are likely to face serious difficulties from the outset. Luckily for them however, the lizard men have prepared these measures against sahuagin attack (in which even they would fight without quarter, to the death if necessary); the lizard men's reaction to intrusion by humans and demi-humans will be less ferocious and they will be more intent on capturing the intruders for questioning by the chief, than on killing. Nevertheless there will be no question of being challenged in this area - the guards and their reinforcements will try to herd the party to the area near the steps, fighting if necessary, there to bind them with straps and hustle them to area 42 to await the arrival of the chief.\n\n50. KOALINTH POOL\n\nYou are in flooded natural rock cavern, very roughly circular and about 70 feet in diameter. In the south-west area of the cavern are two passages, one leading south and the other leading west. At these points the roof descends to between five feet and six feet above the high water mark, but elsewhere the roof rises to perhaps 20 feet above high water.\n\nThe water is quite clear but the bottom is covered with a mass of weed so that the depth cannot be judged. The weed fronds sway gently below the surface - you judge that the tallest fronds have their tips some 20 feet below high water.\n\nAbout two feet above high water level and running along the west wall of the cavern, connecting the two entrances, is a narrow pathway cut out of the rock wall. Midway between them the pathway is connected to a narrow flight of stone steps that leads down into the water.\n\nThe water is roughly 20 feet deep in here at high tide, 10 feet at low tide.\n\nHidden in the weed at the bottom of the pool are seven koalinth - emissaries to the lizard men from their own tribal chief. Each is armed with a spear and a dagger. All carry 2-8 gp in their belt pouches. The leader is wearing a silver armband(value 50 gp) and a Ring of Freedom of Movement (Allows the wearer to act as if continually under the effect of a freedom of movement spell - see Player's Handbook page 207).\n\nNote that these creatures are preparing to leave the lair, having advised the lizard men that they will not be joining the anti-sahuagin alliance. They will be preoccupied with their preparations and if the characters happen to catch them unawares, the koalinth will not be armed. However if they are not surprised, these creatures will immediately attack any party members who enter this area unless they are accompanied by a friendly lizard man, giving priority interest to any elves present with the party. None of them speak common but the leader has a reasonable command of the lizard man tongue.\n\nNoise of melee in here will be heard by the locathah in area 51.\n\nKOALINTH (Aquatic Hobgoblin), Medium-Size Humanoid (Aquatic) \n\nHit Dice\t1d8+2 (7 hit points)\nInitiative\t+1 (Dex)\nSpeed\t30 feet, Swim 40 feet\nAC\t13 (+1 Dex, +2 natural)\nAttacks\tSpear +2 melee, Dagger +2 melee\nDamage\tSpear 1d8+1, Dagger 1d4+1\nSaves\tFort +3, Ref +1, Will +0\nAbilities\tStr 11, Dex 13, Con 13, Int 10, Wis 10, Cha 10\nSkills\tHide +2, Listen +3, Move Silently +3, Spot +3, Swim +11\nFeats\tAlertness, Dodge\n\n51. LOCATHAH POOL\n\nWith slight modifications leg. the entrance to area 52 is in the south-western part of this cavern) the description to area 50 will be adequate here.\n\nThe emissaries in this pool are locathah. These creatures are each armed with a longspear and underwater crossbow. Each has 2-8 gp in a belt pouch. One (the leader) wears an electrum collar set with pearls (value 500 gp). There are four of them as well as four giants eels, the locathah warhorses.\n\nNote that the eels are approximately 20 feet in length. Though the locathah will not be seen at first, since they are in the weeds at the bottom of the pool, the giant eels will easily be seen by any character entering the cavern, as they swim slowly and languorously about.\n\nIf the party melee with the koalinth in the area 50 or with the mermen in area 52, then the noise of combat will draw these locathah to the fight whereupon they will assist their allies against the party. Since they need first to call and mount the giant eels, it will take the locathah three melee rounds to arrive at the scene of the fight from when they first hear it. Otherwise, if the party enter area 51 , the locathah will surface and observe them suspiciously but will not attack unless attacked first or unless the party are accompanied by a sahuagin when they will attack without hesitation. They will not speak to the party and, should the party address them, they will not reply but mutter darkly amongst themselves in their own language.\n\nIf the characters entering this area are accompanied by a friendly lizard man the locathah will be open and friendly.\n\nLOCATHAH, Medium-Size Humanoid (Aquatic) \n\nHit Dice\t2d8 (9 hit points)\nInitiative\t+1 (Dex)\nSpeed\t10 feet, Swim 60 feet\nAC\t14 (+1 Dex, +3 natural)\nAttacks\tLongspear +1 melee, Light crossbow +2 ranged\nDamage\tLongspear 1d8, Light crossbow 1d8\nSaves\tFort +3, Ref +1, Will +1\nAbilities\tStr 10, Dex 12, Con 10, Int 13, Wis 13, Cha 11\nSkills\tCraft (various) +3, Listen +4, Spot +4, Swim +12\nFeats\tBlind-fight\n\nGIANT EEL, Large Animal (Aquatic) \n\nHit Dice\t4d8+6 (26 hit points)\nInitiative\t+3 (Dex)\nSpeed\tSwim 60 feet\nAC\t16 (+3 Dex, +3 natural)\nAttacks\tBite +4 Melee\nDamage\tBite 1d10+4\nSaves\tFort +4, Ref +4, Will +1\nAbilities\tStr 18, Dex 17, Con 15, Int 2, Wis 10, Cha 5\nSkills\tHide +9, Spot +8, Swim +15\nFeats\tPower Attack\n\n52. MERMAN POOL\n\nThe following general description will require amplification, depending on the direction of the party's approach to this area and the circumstances of their entry.\n\nThis is a large sea-cave, roughly circular and with a high roof which in most places is about 25 feet above the high water level. The water is quite clear but a mass of seaweed fronds, swaying gently to and fro prevent you from judging the depth of the water. To the northeast there is a tunnel, perhaps 30 feet wide at most, which appears to lead to another sea-cave; here the roof is only five feet or so above the high water mark.\n\nAbout two feet above high water level and running round the northwest portion of the cavern is a ledge cut out of the rock wall. At its northeast end the pathway follows the curve of the cavern wall into the tunnel, while nearly at its westernmost point an opening has been cut in the rock wall to provide access to a passage beyond. A flight of rough stone steps leads down into the water from the ledge.\n\nIn this pool are five mermen - emissaries to the lizard men from their tribal chief. They are each armed with a trident and an underwater crossbow. One of them - the leader of the group - wears a gold collar set with pearls (value 500 gp).The leader can speak locathah. When the characters enter, the mermen will be hidden in the weeds that grow to a maximum height of seven to eight feet in water that has a maximum depth of 25 feet.\n\nIf melee takes place in area 51 it will be heard by the mermen who will go to that area and assist its occupants. Similarly, melee in the mermen pool will attract the locathah and giant eels from area 51.\n\nIn most circumstances the mermen will not be hostile to characters entering their area (exception: if a sahuagin is with the party then the mermen will attack without hesitation). Indeed they will be reasonably friendly, though unless and until they find out the characters' stance vis-a-vis possible hostilities against the sahuagin, they will not be forthcoming about the alliance being forged by the lizard men. If the characters express anti-sahuagin sentiments, however, the mermen will go to the extent of offering their services as intermediaries in negotiations with the lizard men.\n\nMERFOLK, Medium-Size Humanoid (Aquatic) \n\nHit Dice\t1d8+1 (7 hit points)\nInitiative\t+1 (Dex)\nSpeed\t5 feet, Swim 50 feet\nAC\t13 (+1 Dex, +2 leather)\nAttacks\tTrident +1 melee, Heavy crossbow +2 ranged\nDamage\tTrident 1d8, Heavy crossbow 1d10\nSaves\tFort +3, Ref +1, Will +0\nAbilities\tStr 10, Dex 12, Con 12, Int 11, Wis 11, Cha 13\nSkills\tListen +4, Spot +4\nFeats\tAlertness\n\nCONCLUDING NOTES\n\nIt is possible that a party will ignore or fail to recognize the various clues about the true nature of the lizard men's intentions, in which case they might rampage through the lair killing and looting, making no attempt to enter into an alliance with any of the races present - perhaps failing to recognize that the opportunity to ally exists at all.\n\nIn such an event, if the DM wants the party to continue their adventures in module U3 THE FINAL ENEMY, a rationale for doing so must be provided. Though the DM may be able to provide such a rationale out of the circumstances of the party's adventure in the lair, the following is suggested as one possibility. It assumes there has been wholesale slaughter in the lair and that none of the lair's occupants has escaped to tell the tale.\n\nSeveral days after the party's return to Saltmarsh, a troop of mermen arrives at Saltmarsh, asking to meet the council.\n\nWhen such a meeting takes place, the mermen explain the common danger facing all local races from the sahuagin and inform the council of the alliance the lizard men had initiated to confront this peril.\n\nThe mermen go on to add that the sahuagin appear to have discovered this plot since the lizard men's lair has been attacked in strength. The place has been plundered and no survivors live to tell the tale. (At this point the council members glance somewhat nervously at each other ... but these men are politicians and quickly reach a tacit agreement to keep their mouths shut as to where true responsibility for this slaughter lies. After all, no evidence of their direct involvement in the massacre apparently now remains...)\n\nThe mermen continue to explain that the lizard men have all been killed and the koalinth have left the alliance. However they earnestly request that the humans of Saltmarsh join them against the common enemy.\n\nThe Council agrees to assist the aquatic races against the sahuagin; indeed, they know where there is a party of adventurers who might be willing to take an active part ...\n\nIt will be perfectly evident, by now, that module U3 is all about an assault on the Sahuagin stronghold!\n\nTHIS ENDS THE DANGER AT DUNWATER ADVENTURE\nUNLESS THE OPTIONAL VENTURE (BELOW) IS REQU IRED.\n\nOPTIONAL VENTURE\n\nNote: This section is to be used if the DM considers it necessary to solve the wergild problem (see HUMAN INVOLVEMENT IN THE ALLIANCE). It may be used in combination with one or more of suggestions in the same section or in isolation.\n\nReminder: The lizard man chief must demand some recompense for losses the characters have inflicted on his people, and if the characters here are to adventure in module U3 they must satisfy the chief on this score. However the chief would be willing to waive payment of the wergild altogether if the party will put an end to the menace the lizard men have discovered and which makes their life in this present lair somewhat hazardous.\n\nOutline\n\nThis boxed section may be read to the players. In effect, it is what the lizard man chief tells the party should the debate about wergild have evolved to the point at which this venture might be put forward by the chief as a solution to the problem.\n\nWhen the lizard men returned to this long-abandoned lair, they soon discovered that a giant crocodile had its lair in the marshes nearby. The discovery did not initially perturb the lizard men. Firstly, crocodiles are sacred to this tribe and they regarded its presence as a good omen. Secondly, the lizard men have limited empathic control over crocodiles and thus perceived it as no danger.\n\nTheir complacency was rudely shattered when the crocodile attacked and devoured three members of a lizard man patrol that had paused near the crocodile's lair. The survivors of this attack reported that their attempts to control the creature in the usual way had failed miserably and that they had barely escaped alive. The major difficulty now facing the chief is that the lizard men cannot attack the crocodile for it and its kind are sacred to the tribe and to attack it would be taboo.\n\nSince then matters have got even worse. The crocodile has on a number of occasions taken unawares lizard men parties doing a routine patrol of the marshes, killing and eating several lizard man warriors (and on one occasion an officer). Since the crocodile's lair lies very close to a possible route of approach of a sahuagin attack, the lizard men dare not leave that area unpatrolled. However the depredations of the creature are starting to have serious manpower implications - the lizard men's fighting strength is being progressively whittled away.\n\nThere would be no violation of sacred taboo were the adventurers to kill the crocodile on the lizard men's behalf.\n\nThe party must gain no hint of this, but the reason the crocodile does not respond to the lizard men's attempts to control it, eating them quite happily, is that it is itself being controlled by the charm reptiles ability of a very young black dragon whose lair is adjacent to that of the crocodile. (See the map inside the module folder.)\n\n(Note: some liberty has been taken with the charm reptiles ability for the purposes of maintaining the original scenario idea.)\n\nThe dragon is in no sense acting on behalf of the sahuagin - it has no knowledge of their role nor they of it. It does, however, have a considerable treasure (see below) and its neighbour the giant crocodile is an ideal watchdog.\n\nF. GIANT CROCODILE LAIR\n\nAt the junction of the River Dunwater and a river tributary there is a large pool of water rimmed by tufts of reed and grass, with the occasional tree of appropriate type (willow, cypress etc.) and clumps of spiky bushes. This is the lair of the giant crocodile, approximately on the south side (see map inside module folder) is a denser area of trees; this conceals the lair of the dragon.\n\nThe crocodile will not initially be visible but no sooner has the party approached the area than it will attack, surfacing rapidly in the large pool and waddling towards them, bellowing as it comes. So far as the creature is concerned, the party is simply another lizard man patrol and thus several tasty morsels.\n\nThe noise of melee will attract the dragon in its lair and it will peer through the gap in the trees, initially in casual interest. It will immediately recognise that the party presents a much greater threat than the expected lizard man patrol and will hasten to attack (its first attack will therefore take place after three rounds of melee between the party and the crocodile).\n\nG. DRAGON LAIR\n\nAgain, this is a marshy area but in this case enclosed in a roughly circular ring of trees, perhaps 10 yards in diameter. At the north edge there is a 25-foot wide gap in the trees forming a natural entrance and link with the crocodile pool.\n\nThe dragon lair is approximately in the centre of the glade and it is on a relatively dry patch that the beast's hoard can be found, concealed carefully with a covering of moss, tufts of muddy grass and reed. The treasure consists of:\n\nA heap of coins made up of 4,800 cp, 1,700 gp and 78 pp.\n\nIn the heap of coins is a necklace studded with rubies and diamonds, value 3,800 gp.\n\nA scroll (Protection from Undead) in a stoppered bone tube.\n\nA keen scimitar +l in a leather sheath (Scores a critical hit on a roll of 15-20).\n\nAn iron box (unlocked) that contains an agate on a thin silver chain. The stone appears to be worth only about 50 gp but is in fact a Periapt of Proof against Poison. The wearer of the periapt gains a +4 luck saving throw bonus against any type of poison.\n\nGIANT CROCODILE, Huge Animal (Aquatic)\n\nHit Dice\t7d8+28 (59 hit points)\nInitiative\t+1 (Dex)\nSpeed\t20 feet, Swim 30 feet\nAC\t16 (-2 size, +1 Dex, +7 natural)\nAttacks\tBite +11 melee or Tail slap +11 melee\nDamage\tBite 2d8+12, Tail slap 1d12+12\nSpecial Attacks\tImproved grab\nSaves\tFort +9, Ref +6, Will +3\nAbilities\tStr 27, Dex 12, Con 19, Int 1, Wis 12, Cha 2\nSkills\tListen +5, Spot +5, Hide +12 (when submerged)\nNotes\tImproved grab: To use its improved grab ability the crocodile must hit a medium-sized or smaller opponent with its bite attack. If it gets a hold, the crocodile grabs the opponent with its mouth and drags it into deep water, attempting to pin it to the bottom. The crocodile automatically deals bite damage each round it maintains the pin.\n\nBLACK DRAGON, Very Young\n\nHit Dice\t7d12+7 (52 hit points)\nInitiative\t+1 (Dex)\nSpeed\t60 feet, Fly 100 feet (poor), Swim 60 feet\nAC\t17 (+1 size, +6 natural)\nAttacks\tBite +9 melee, Claw +9 melee\nDamage\tBite 1d6+1, Claw 1d4\nSpecial Attacks\tBreath Weapon\nSpecial Qualities\tBlindsight, Immunities, Water Breathing\nSaves\tFort +6, Ref +5, Will +5\nAbilities\tStr 13, Dex 10, Con 13, Int 8, Wis 11, Cha 8\nSkills\tConcentration +7, Knowledge (swamp) +4, Listen +10, Spot +10, Search +7\nFeats\tAlertness, Flyby attack\nNotes\tBreath Weapon: The black dragon’s breath weapon is a 5-foot wide stream of acid, 40 feet in length. The acid causes 4d4 points of damage (Reflex save vs. DC 14 for half damage). The breath weapon can be used once every 1d4 rounds. \n\tBlindsight: The dragon can ascertain creatures within 60 feet by non visual means. \n\tImmunities: Black dragons are immune to sleep, paralysis and acid.\n\nAPPENDIX\n\nTHE PLOT (précis for the Dungeon Master)\n\nA colony of lizard men has recently re-established possession of a lizard man stronghold previously abandoned many years before. The lizard men are also known to have bought large quantities of weapons from a gang of smugglers (who were also, before the gang was routed, smuggling contraband goods to Saltmarsh - see module U1 THE SINISTER SECRET OF SALTMARSH. \n\nThe members of the Saltmarsh Town Council are fearful of these developments lest their own little fishing town is to be the target of the aggression for which the lizard men are obviously preparing. They approach a party of adventurers and ask for aid in ridding Saltmarsh of the menace.\n\nUnknown to the Town Council (and to the adventurers) the lizard men are not planning an attack on Saltmarsh. Rather, they are anxious to rid the area of the menace posed by an invading horde of sahuagin. To this end, the lizard men are negotiating with several other tribes - of mermen, koalinth and locathah - to gain allies in the struggle to come.\n\nThe problems facing the lizard men could possibly be amplified by internal dissent, though as yet this dissent has not come out into the open. Some of the lizard men in the colony do not agree with the idea of allying with other races, even in the face of the sahuagin threat, since they hold this is contrary to the teachings of their god, Semuanya. These dissenters dare not oppose their chief yet, but if his authority and that of his senior officers were removed, they would make their feelings known in no uncertain manner.\n\nDESCRIPTIONS OF MONSTERS\n\nLizard Men\n\nThere are large numbers of lizard men in the stronghold, from the chief to the children. For convenience, the DM may wish to use the statistics which follow, selected as appropriate to the circumstances, whenever lizard men are encountered, though the DM should feel free to alter the statistics to add variety.\n\nLIZARDMAN CHIEF, 6th level ranger\n\nHit Dice\t6d10+12 (48 hit points)\nInitiative\t+2\nSpeed\t30 feet\nAC\t19 (+5 natural, +2 Dex, +2 Ring)\nAttacks\tBroadsword +11/+6 melee, Shortsword +10/+5 melee, Javelin +6/+1 ranged\nDamage\tBroadsword 1d8+6, Shortsword (off hand) 1d6+2, Javelin 1d6+5\nSaves\tFort +7, Ref +4, Will +3\nAbilities\tStr 18, Dex 15, Con 15, Int 12, Wis 12, Cha 13\nSkills\tAnimal Empathy +5, Handle Animal +6, Hide +6, Intuit Direction +6, Jump +10, Listen +6, Move Silently +6, Search +6, Spot +7, Swim +13, Wilderness Lore +6\nSpecial Abilities\tFavoured enemies (Animals, Aquatic humanoids)\nFeats\tMultiattack, Ambidexterity and Two-weapon fighting (Ranger), Tracking (Ranger), Weapon focus (broadsword), Power Attack\nNotes\tThe gold collar round his neck and the gold armband on his left forearm are worth 300 gp each.

It uses a map from the Map-a-Week collection at the Wizards of the Coast website: \nhttp://www.wizards.com/dnd/images/mapofweek/darkcrypt.jpg.\n\n\nBackground (for the DM only):  The crypt is several hundred years old.  Originally a burial chamber built by some long-forgotten race, it lay undisturbed for a couple of centuries.  It was uncovered, opened, and stripped of its grave goods; then a group of bandits (or maybe they were a fugitive cult of devil-worshippers; it’s hard to say) dug out a secret hideaway behind the original tombs.  Other tenants moved in later.  It is now occupied by a clutch of troglodytes, who use it as a place from which to stage raids on nearby human and elven settlements.\n\n\nExterior entrance:  The crypt was built into the side of a mountain, with an elaborate carved stone façade.  It was later partially covered by landslides.  The adventurers see what looks like a natural cave entrance, big enough for a man to enter comfortably.  Only when they get inside do they notice that the walls are carved stone, covered with hauntingly beautiful patterns of interwoven lines and strange writing in a language no living man knows.\n\n\n1:  This is a large chamber.  The floor is wet from seepage of groundwater through the ceiling.  There is an elaborate set of double brass doors, open slightly, leading into area 1a.\nOn a DC 15 spot check, the players notice the tracks of  the troglodytes going from the entrance to the double doors.\nA swarm of bats (Monster Manual, p.237) lives here.  If the players are noisy, they awaken the bats and the swarm attacks.  \n\n\n1a:  The outer chamber of the crypt.  The double doors leading to the inner chamber are also ajar; these doors are more deteriorated due to the dampness.  If the players did not spot the troglodytes’ tracks in area 1, they take another check here.\n\n\n2:  The stone door to the crypt is wide open.  This chamber was once elaborately painted, but the decoration is badly deteriorated.    If the players did not spot the troglodytes’ tracks in area 1 or 1a, they take yet another check here.\n\n\n3a:  There are stone doors in all directions.  Each door is marked with the name of the deceased in elaborate writing.  Nobody in the party can read the names; it’s a lost language.  DC 24 vs. Strength to open any one of the doors; two people can work together (use highest Strength + ½ of the second person’s) to open one door.\nThere is a peephole in the door to chamber 3d; DC 25 for the party to Spot it.  There is a 5% chance that a troglodyte (Monster Manual, p. 246, with modifications explained below) is watching through the peephole.  If so, the troglodyte barricades the door on the other side (DC 22 Listen for the party to hear this; that door now cannot be opened, period) and goes to alert the rest of the clutch.  Three minutes later, the troglodytes, accompanied by their monitor lizards, will attack the party in force, emerging simultaneously from all three burial chambers—two troglodytes from each direction; one monitor lizard accompanying the pair of troglodytes in chamber 3b, and the other lizard with the pair in 3c.  If the party has managed to penetrate chambers 3b or 3c, they meet a lizard and two troglodytes emerging from the secret door; two rounds later, the other lizard and the rest of the troglodytes come through the door and hit them from the other side!  (Unengaged party members, or animal companions, may hear the second group of troglodytes coming, however.)\n\n\n3b, 3c, and 3d:  Each burial chamber is elaborately decorated, and contains a stone sarcophagus.  The lid is ajar, or off, and there’s a scattering of old bones (humanoid of some sort) inside.  There is no treasure, and nothing of significance; the grave robbers came and went long ago.  Chamber 3d is more elaborate than the other two; the king/chieftain/high priest/Mr. Moneybags was buried there.\nDC 20 Search to spot the secret door in the wall opposite the main entrance.  DC 22 Pick Lock to open.\n\n\nBetween 3b, 3c, or 3d and 4:  These passages are one man (or troglodyte) wide.  DC 10 Knowledge (Architecture or Dungeoneering) to notice that the passages are built in a different style (and with a much lower level of skill) than the burial chambers.  \nWhile in the passage between 3d and 4, there is a 5% chance of meeting a troglodyte coming the other way.  Animal companions may smell and react to the presence of the lizards in area 4.\n\n\n4:  The two monitor lizards (Monster Manual, p. 275) are chained to the walls in here when not in use.  The chains are long enough that no one can pass through without the lizards having something to say about it.  The lizards will attack anyone who’s not a troglodyte.\nIf the players have not encountered the troglodytes before arriving here, and if they melee or otherwise arouse the lizards, the troglodytes will be alerted.  If the players manage to subdue or evade the lizards, and they are using any sort of light source, once they pass into area 4, the troglodytes (who have darkvision, and thus do not use torches) will be alerted.\nWhen the troglodytes are alerted, the chieftain and three other troglodytes will rush to area 4, weapons ready, and looking for a fight.  They will fight until:\nthe party is destroyed, or \nthe chieftain, or two of the other troglodytes, are out of action\nIn the latter case, the surviving troglodytes disengage and flee to area 6.  \nThe other two troglodytes withdraw to area 6 when the alarm is raised and guard the eggs.  They, and any retreating troglodytes who join them there, will fight to the death.\n\n\n5:  This is the troglodytes’ main living area.  If they have not previously been alerted when the party walks in, they’ll be plenty alert now!  Items of treasure present amongst the clutter (troglodytes have poor housekeeping skills):\none dozen troglodyte javelins – market value only 8 silver pieces each, because they’re ugly and look like they’re not well made; they work just fine, though\ntwo short swords\na morningstar\nfour steel hooded lanterns\na masterwork dwarven war-hammer\na torn and shredded wizard’s robe, formerly belonging to a wizard who got a little torn and shredded himself when the troglodytes caught him in bed sleeping – DC 20 Search of the robe’s pockets will reveal a ring of spell storing, minor, which is empty, and a potion of cure light wounds which is labeled as such on the bottle.\n50 feet of rope\na map case, containing local maps\na guitar\n25 GP worth of craftsmen’s tools, including a couple of nice big sledgehammers\n34 GP, 65 SP, and 31 CP\nThe passage exiting to the north is bricked up.  DC 27 vs. Strength, using the sledgehammers, to break it open.  Two people can attack the wall at once, each making a separate check per round of bashing\n\n\n6:  The troglodytes store and prepare food here; there is also a clutch of six troglodyte eggs.\nThe statue in the corner is a masterwork representation of a six-foot humanoid with long, bony fingers and flattened facial features.  It is dressed in layers of robes, and holds a long staff.  The statue would be worth a fortune if you could haul it out and sell it to a collector.  You can’t; there’s a spell gluing it to the floor.\nDC 22 Search to spot the secret door behind the statue.  DC 26 Pick Lock to open.\n\n\n7:  This portion of the crypt was remodeled into a treasure vault by Nognor, an ambitious evil sorcerer who is now long dead (we think . . . we hope).  These passages have not been trodden in hundreds of years.  DC 5 Spot to notice that the troglodytes have never been in here.\n\n\n8:  There is a rickety wooden bridge spanning a 15 foot wide pit.  In the pit is what looks like tar or black oil; it’s actually a black pudding (Monster Manual, p. 201) that Nognor captured and, by means of a curse, has imprisoned here to serve as a trap.  The pudding has the same characteristics as shown in the Manual, but it cannot move out of the pit or attack anyone on the bridge above.  The curse has made the pudding immortal . . . but it hasn’t eaten in a couple centuries.\nThe bridge was once a mechanical trap, but the mechanism has deteriorated with age and no longer works quite as designed.  If the party simply charges across the bridge, the bridge will tilt suddenly and whoever is on it will fall into the Black Pudding to be consumed.  There used to be a disarming mechanism, to allow Nognor to cross without falling into his own trap, but it no longer works.\nDC 18 Balance for one character to work his way carefully to the other side—halflings or gnomes get +5 on this check because they are small and light and therefore less likely to trip the mechanism.  If the character succeeds, and if he was smart enough to take one end of a rope with him, the players can rig up a safety line so that all may cross in safety (but the DM should make some dummy dice rolls here just to make ‘em nervous).\n\n\n9:  This door has a permanent magic mouth spell on it.  When the first person is within 10 feet of the door, it announces in a loud voice:\nTurn back!  Turn back!  Come no further, for death awaits you  within!  The curse of Nognor be upon you if you take another step!\nThere’s no curse, really—Nognor was a bit of a show-off and a bluffer.  However, if, after taking another step forward, the player fails a DC 25 Fortitude save, he thinks he feels the tingle of magic, and should thereafter be encouraged to believe he’s been cursed.  Won’t that be fun?\n\n\n10:  Nognor’s treasure room.  It is guarded by a bugbear zombie (Monster Manual, p. 267, top).  Once the zombie is defeated, the treasure present is:\n551 gold pieces\na  magic +1 longsword with the shock ability\njewelry worth 645 gold pieces\nseveral potion flasks, the contents of which evaporated years ago – the flasks could be sold for 25 GP\na magic +2 quarterstaff with the dancing ability.  This weapon has a drawback: the first time it is used in combat, the user’s skin turns Ooompa-Loompa orange.  This effect lasts for as long as he owns the weapon.\n\n\nTroglodyte Clutch:  There are six adult troglodytes in the clutch.  They are as described in the Monster Manual at page 246, with the following changes:\nThe chieftain is level 3, has 21 hit points, and carries a heavy mace (1d8+1, x2) instead of a club.\nOne of the other troglodytes uses a hand axe (1d6+2, x3) instead of a club.\nThe troglodytes do not use javelins indoors.  They used to, but . . . it’s like your mom said, it’s always funny until someone loses an eye.\n", "UK5 Eye Of The Serpent\nAn AD&D 1st Edition One-on-One or Group Adventure for First Level Characters\nProduct Number: 9125\nYear Published: 1984\nConverted from 1st Edition to 3rd Edition D&D\nBy Simon Collins: \nLast Updated: 10.7.01\nThis conversion presumes that you own UK5 Eye of the Serpent. It is recommended that you also own the AD&D 1st Edition Monster Manual I and II, and the Fiend Folio, for monster descriptions beyond statistics and special abilities, as these are not included in the conversion. Please note that I deliberately did not use the 2nd Edition Monstrous Manual for conversion purposes, in order to keep the flavour of the original 1st Edition monsters. Where possible, I have also retained the hit points and alignment of the original monsters.\nThere are many monsters new to 3rd Edition in this module, for which I used a mixture of the text of the module, the statistics from the 1st Edition manuals, the 3rd Edition Monster Manual, Skip Williams’ ‘How To Create A Monster’ article, and at times my own interpretation, to convert them. But nobody’s perfect. Not even me! If you spot mistakes in this and want to correct me, feel free to politely do so by sending me an e-mail and I’ll do my best to make any amendments as soon as possible. \nRandom Encounters\n2 Wolves – MM p.204, 12 hp each\n1d3+5 Giant Rats – see Dire Rat, MM p.56, 3 hp each\n2 Giant Killer Frogs – see Encounter 28, below, 9 hp each\n2 Blood Hawks – see Encounter 9, below, 6 hp each\n5 Giant Bats – see Dire Bat, MM p.57, 5 hp each\n2 Giant Ants – MM p.205, 9 hp each\n2 Giant Fire Beetles – MM p.206, 8 hp each\n1 Eagle – MM p.196, 6 hp\n\n1.

It can drop a snatched creature as a free action or use a standard action to fling it aside. A flung creature travels 90 feet and takes 9d6 points of damage. If the roc flings it while flying, the creature suffers this amount of damage or falling damage, whichever is greater.\nSkills: * Rocs receive a +4 racial bonus to Spot checks during daylight hours.\n\nIce Heights\n2.

To use this ability, the snow cat must hit with its bite attack. If it gets a hold, it can rake.\nRake (Ex): A snow cat that gets a hold can make two rake attacks (+4 melee) with its hind legs for 1d3+2 damage each. If the snow cat pounces upon an opponent, it can also rake.\nSpecial Qualities:\nScent (Ex): See MM p.10.\nSkills: A snow cat receives a +4 racial bonus to Balance, Hide and Move Silently checks. * In areas of snow or ice, the Hide bonus improves to +8.\n\n4.

From time to time, however, the bodies of their humanoid victims lie where they fell, to rise as lacedons themselves in 1d4 days. Casting protection from evil on a body before the end of that time averts the transformation.\nSpecial Qualities:\nUndead: Immune to mind-influencing effects, poison, sleep, paralysis, stunning, and disease. Not subject to critical hits, subdual damage, ability damage, energy drain, or death from massive damage.\nTurn Resistance: See MM p.10.\n\n6.

Any \nrace or class is suitable for the adventure, although an elf or a cleric in the \nparty would be good as ghouls are the primary foe.  Having a character \ncapable of tracking would also be helpful, but it is not completely necessary.  \nThe adventure may be placed in any wooded area of any campaign world. \n \n\nAdventure Overview \n \nThe PCs enter the village of Lavender \nSprings only to hear tales of \ncannibalism, disappearing corpses and \ndangerous woods.  Investigation reveals \nthat there are indeed ghouls in the \nwoods north of the village.  Nightfall \nbrings the PCs to the home of Silyna, the \nsource of the evil.  Feigning innocence, \nSilyna offers hospitality only to attempt \nan assassination of the PCs while they \nare asleep.  If killed Silyna rises as a \nghoul herself. \n \nBackground \n \nLavender Springs is a secluded forest \nvillage (AL CG; 200 gp limit; Pop. 732) \nwith a growing problem.  One month \nago, a young man, Denjin by name, was \n\ncaptured and killed after he was found \neating the body of one of the villagers.  \nDenjin’s body was left to hang \novernight, but come morning it was \ngone.  Since that time a growing number \nof people have been disappearing.  \nLocal hunters have found blood-\ndrenched scraps of clothing and animal \nskins but never any bodies.  The \nvillagers are afraid that ghouls now \nhaunt the forest. The people of \nLavender Springs have grown \nincreasingly frightened of entering the \nforest, and this has threatened their \nlivelihood.  The people of this village \nlive off of hunting and gathering the \nwild fruits and nuts of the forests, and \nharvesting the wild grains in a large \nclearing south of the village on the other \nside of the wood. \n\n \n MIDGARD: Online d20 Adventures: http://www.rpg-e.com/enworld/midgard/ \n \n\n\n\nFEAST OR FAMINE\nFor the GM \n \n\nApproximately three miles \nnorth of Lavender Springs a \nsorceress named Silyna is engaged in \na bizarre plot to achieve immortality.  \nKnowing she lacks the power to \nachieve full lichdom, Silyna has \ndecided to become a powerful ghoul \ninstead.  She has long studied the \nmatter and through a \ncombination of potent \npotions and dark pacts she \nis well on her way to \nachieving success.  One of \nthe requirements put upon \nher by the various dark \nentities she has bargained \nwith is that she actively \nengages in cannibalism.  \nThis Silyna willingly did \nand encouraged her son \nDenjin to do likewise.  He \nmoved to Lavender \nSprings at her behest to \nhelp recruit followers who \nshe could lead in worship of these \ndark entities and rule area. \n Silyna’s plans recently came \nto a head when Denjin foolishly \nmurdered a man in the middle of the \nvillage and was caught.  It was \nSilyna who cut down Denjin in the \ndead of night.  To Silyna’s delight, \nDenjin had already risen as a ghoul, \nretaining a good portion of his \nhuman memory in the process.  \nHand in claw, the two returned \nhome and the nightmare began for \nthe people of Lavender Springs. \n \n \n\nBeginning the Adventure \n \n It is left to the DM to \ndetermine why the PCs are in \nLavender Springs.  Whatever the \nreason, they are drawn into the \nadventure as soon as they enter the \nvillage.  Amazed that someone made \nit through the woods alive to reach \ntheir isolated town, the PCs will be \n\noverwhelmed by curious \ntownsfolk.   They do not \nknow that the portion of the \nwoods the PCs came \nthrough is relatively safe \n(see Adventure Area). \n\nDrawn by the crowd and \nrecognizing the PCs as \npossible adventurers, the \nmayor, Girkin Rothfell \n(Male Human Exp4 \n(Blacksmith)) will introduce \nhimself.  He and his people \nare growing desperate.  The \ntotal number of dead and \nmissing has risen to forty-\n\nfive.  Many, including the mayor, are \nbeginning to believe that the area is \ncursed.  The PCs are offered 150 gold \npieces each if they will end the \nmenace.  It is a sizable sum by the \nstandards of the small village. \n\nThe villagers can offer little in the \nway of clues.  They can relate the tale \nof Denjin’s execution, which they \nrightly associate with the present \nproblem, but all they know about \nhim was that he came to the town \nseveral months ago, built a hut on \nthe edge of town and kept to himself, \nfashioning simple leather goods for a \nliving.  A few villagers can tell the \n\n MIDGARD: Online d20 Adventures: http://www.rpg-e.com/enworld/midgard/\n\nAdventure Area\n \nThe details of the \nlocation and layout of \nLavender Springs are \nleft to the DM in order \nto fit his campaign. \n \nLavender Springs \nitself should be \nsurrounded by a \nforest, but be closer to \nthe edge the PCs are \ntraveling from, and \nthicker through the \nother side to Silyna’s \ncottage. \n\n\n\nPCs that Denjin seemed “too big for \nhis britches” and often began \nconversations bordering on \nblasphemy; questioning the role of \nthe gods in the lives of these people.  \nDenjin’s hut was razed after his body \ndisappeared and the other \ndisappearances soon started.  \n \n\nQuestioning the families of those \nwho disappeared, the party should \nbe able to discover that most of the \ndisappearances happened early in \nthe morning or later in the evening, \nand in the portion of the woods \nnorth and west of the village. \n\nThey can also tell the PCs that \nmany animals have also been found \ndead, that the woods have been \ngenerally free of monsters and that a \n“witch” lives by herself somewhere \nnorth of the village beyond the \nwoods.  They do not know her name \nand only know she rarely comes to \nthe village to trade and began to \nappear a little over a year ago. \n\nNone of the villagers have ever \nconnected Denjin with his mother \nSilyna, as the two of them were \nnever seen speaking together.   \n  \nEncounters in the Woods \n \n\nThe ghouls now haunting the \nforest have killed or driven off many \nof the local animals and the PCs will \nsoon find the forest unnaturally \nquiet.  Characters with wilderness \nskills will be especially unnerved.  \nThe GM may play this part of the \nadventure as fast or as slow as seems \nright, though some time should be \nspent building suspense.  Encounters \n\nin the forest may include the \nfollowing: \n\n• (EL 0) The corpse of a bear, \nmost of which has been eaten.  \nFlies buzz around the few \nbones and scraps of fur that \nremain.  The bear has been \ndead a few days. \n\n• (EL 0) Noisy black crows take \noff into the air just east of the \nparty, breaking the stillness.  \nInvestigation will turn up \nnothing. \n\n• (EL 0) Scraps of bloody \nclothing are found, as is a \ngold ring (10 gp). \n\n• (EL 0) A bloody boot is \nwedged into some rocks.  A \nhuman foot is still in the boot.   \n\n• (EL 1) A mutilated body of a \nrabbit is spotted, just recently \nkilled.  Boot prints lead away \nfrom the corpse.  A ghoul lies \nwaiting in ambush. \n\n• (EL 3) The party sees a pack of \n3 ghouls feasting on the \ncorpse of a man in a ravine.  \nAs soon as the ghouls spot or \nhear the party, they scatter \nand attempt to flank the PCs. \n \n\nThe DM may create other \nencounters of a like nature if is \nseems appropriate.  Eventually the \nPCs spot a cottage through the trees, \njust over the next hill.  Ideally night \nis closing in even as a heavy and \ncold rain begins to fall. \n \nThe House of Ghouls \n \n\n MIDGARD: Online d20 Adventures: http://www.rpg-e.com/enworld/midgard/\n\nFEAST OR FAMINE\n\n\n\nThe cottage belongs to Silyna.  Silyna \nis a middle-aged woman with a \npleasant round face, graying hair \nand bright blue eyes.  She greets the \nPCs cordially at the door and urges \nthem to come in out of the rain.  She \nmentions that there have been \nstrange sounds lately and that the \nforest does not seem safe anymore.  \nLikewise she offers them food and \nshelter for the night.  Her house is \ncozy and warm, but filled with \nstrange and pungent odors.  Many \nherbs hang on the walls of each \nroom and the PCs may decide that \nthey are the source of the smells.   \n \nIf questioned about the \ndisappearances and ghouls she will \nsay the following: \n\n• She has seen and heard \nfigures wandering around \noutside at night, but keep her \ndoor tightly bolted.  Once or \ntwice they banged at her door, \nbut obviously no one came in. \n\n• When she searches for herbs \nin the early morning she has \nnever been attacked or seen \nghouls, but she has seen dead \nanimals. \n\n• She says she knows about a \n“Black Tree Stump” in the \nwoods that she gets creepy \nfeelings from and that may be \nthe source of the evil. She \npromises to shoe the party the \nplace in the morning.  (This is \na lie.  There is no stump.) \n\n• (If questioned about the \nportrait in her bedroom): She \n\nexplains that is her son, who \nis a ranger and stops by every \nfew weeks, she has not seen \nhim in at least three weeks, \nbut he spends a great deal of \ntime in the wilderness. \n\n \n \nThe rooms of the cottage are as \nfollows. \n \nC1 - Entry-hall and stairway.   \nThe wooden floor boards of the this \nhall are worn and warped.  Simple \nwooden doors flank to the left and \nright, while a wooden stairway leads \nup to the upper floor. Beneath where \nthe stairway turns a beaded curtain \ncreates a small storage closet.  \n \nThe small closet under the stairs is \nfilled with boxes, brooms, buckets \nand the like.  The stairs lead up to \nthe guest room. The doors to the \nrooms are thin and have no locks \nand can be closed from the inside \nwith simple wooden slide bolts. \n \nC2 - Kitchen.  \nPans, knives and spices hang from \nthe walls.  A fire is burning in the \nfireplace.  The table can seat six. The \nfloor is covered in a layer of \nsawdust, and the several sausage \nstrings hang from the ceiling by the \npot-bellied stove.  The smell of herbs \nand incense that fills the rest of the \nhouse are almost overwhelming \nhere. \n \nMany of the spices on the wall rack \ndeadly poison, but only someone \n\n MIDGARD: Online d20 Adventures: http://www.rpg-e.com/enworld/midgard/ \n\nFEAST OR FAMINE\n\n\n\nwith knowledge of plants will be \nable to recognize this (DC 19).  They \nare mixed in with the normal spices, \nso grabbing a random bottle of \nspices has a 1 in 8 chance of grabbing \na poisonous one.  Silyna knows the \ncontents of each very well.  There are \n32 different bottles of poison/spices \nand the GM should choose poisons \nhe feels are appropriate to his \nsetting. \n \nC3 - Bedroom.  \nThis is obviously a bedroom.  A \nbroad bed stands in one corner, with \na small chest at its foot, and a chest \nof drawers in the other corner beside \nit.  There is a low bookshelf in the \ncorner opposite the door, with \nvarious knick-knacks atop of it, and \na throw rug on the floor beside the \nbed. There is a portrait of a young \nman with dark hair and green eyes \nabove the chest of drawers \n \n The portrait is of Denjin.  If \nany of the PC got a description of the \nyoung man that was hung, they can \nmake an Intelligence check (DC 18) \nto be fairly certain that that is who \nthe portrait shows.  The painting is \nnot well done, but could garner as \nmuch as 5 gps for a collector of rural \nart. \n The bookshelf only has six \nbooks.  They are: \n\n• One is an illustrated guide on \nlocal plants and herbs (worth \n60 gps). \n\n• One is a book on \nmummification (worth 90 \ngps). \n\n• There is a four book set on the \nworship of Wee Jas (or other \ngod appropriate to your \nsetting), going into a great \namount of detail on undead \nand necromancy in general \n(worth 400 gps as a set, or 80 \ngps each if sold separately). \n\n \nThe knick-knacks are local crafts and \nstatuettes of animal forms.  They are \nall made of wood or stone and can \nbe valued between 1 and 9 sps each. \n\n \nBeneath the throw rug is the trap \ndoor to the cellar. \n \nC4 - Guestroom.   \nThe odors of the house are less \nobnoxious in this room.  There are \nfour beds squeezed in here and a \nthrow rug in the middle of the floor.  \n \n This is where Silyna will put the PCs \nup for the night. (see An Attempt at \nMurder below). \n \nC5 - Cellar.  \nThe stairs creak loudly as you \ndescend, and the strange underlying \nsmell of the rest of the house \nbecomes distilled here to be none \nother than the well-known smell of \ndeath.  The floor is made of packed \ndirt and the walls are stones of \nvarious shapes and sizes fitted \ntogether.  The place is scattered with \nhuman arms, legs and heads.  In one \ncorner, a young man sits chained to \nthe wall, sobbing.  His leg seems to \nhave been removed at the knee. \n \n\n MIDGARD: Online d20 Adventures: http://www.rpg-e.com/enworld/midgard/ \n\nFEAST OR FAMINE\n\n\n\nThis room is the real source of the \nodors in the house above.  Body \nparts of no less than 20 people (plus \nan assortment of animals) provide a \nlarder of sorts for Silyna and her \nghouls.  If not already encountered \nelsewhere, Denjin and two other \nghouls will be met in this room. \n \nThe young man is Thomas \nGrodman.  A young shepherd  from \nLavender Springs, he was the last to \ndisappear.  There is a tourniquet \napplied at his knee to keep him from \nbleeding out.  He is in shock and a \nlot of pain and is basically \nincoherent.  He is being kept alive to \nprovide fresh meat for the ghouls \nuntil more people are captured. \n \nAn attempt at Murder (EL 6) \n\n Silyna has a simple plan for \ndealing with visitors.  She feeds \nthem drugged food causing them to \nbecome drowsy and eventually fall \ninto a deep sleep.  PCs who eat any \nof Silyna’s food must make a \nFortitude Save (DC 14) to avoid \nfalling soundly asleep for 1d8 hours.   \n Those who make their save \nare unlikely to notice anything, since \nit will be late and the party should be \ntired anyway.  Those who fail \nbecome increasingly drowsy and \nthen fall asleep, so there is no \nimmediate descent into \nunconsciousness to raise suspicions. \n\nWhile the PCs are asleep in \ntheir beds, Silyna, Denjin and the \nother two ghouls in the house enter \nthe guestroom with murder in mind.  \n\nThey enter after the PCs have been \nasleep for 2 hours. \n\n \nAnyone who is asleep and not \n\neffected by the poison may make a \nListen check (DC 20) to hear Silyna \nand the ghouls coming up the \ncreaking steps, and another check \n(DC 18) to hear the door creaking \nopen.   Anyone who is fully awake \nneed only make a check against DC \n10, and automatically hears the door \ncreak open. \n\n \nIn combat Silyna makes great \n\nuse of invisibility, attacking only to \ndisappear again.  Denjin and the \nother ghouls are less subtle in their \nmethod of attack.  Silyna fights to the \ndeath, but the ghouls attempt to flee \nif they feel they are losing the battle. \n\n \nNote: This can be an \n\nextremely deadly encounter for the \nPCs.  If they all failed their saves, \nthey can be killed outright, unless \nsomeone is affected by the poison for \nonly two hours or less.  And unless \nthey set a guard, they will not be \narmor or have weapons ready \n(unless they specifically make \nprecautions for this).    \n\n \nShe Only Lives Twice \n \n\nIt is likely that the PCs will \nkill Silyna, possibly as she is \nattempting to assassinate them in \ntheir sleep.  If nothing is done to \ndestroy or purify her body, Silyna \nwill rise as a ghoul with sorcerous \npowers in the space of twelve hours.  \nIf the PCs are still around, she hunts \n\n MIDGARD: Online d20 Adventures: http://www.rpg-e.com/enworld/midgard/ \n\nFEAST OR FAMINE\n\n\n\nthem down.  As her ultimate goal is \nto live forever, if she feels the PCs \nare too powerful for her, she flees \nand bides her time while creating an \narmy of ghouls loyal to her.  If this \nhappens, it is entirely possible that \nthe village of Lavender Springs is \ndoomed. \n \nSilyna, Denjin and the Ghouls \n \n\nThe potions and pacts that \nSilyna has ingested and made make \nit possible for both her and Denjin to \nbecome ghouls while retaining their \nhuman abilities.  Both also have the \nability to command ghouls that they \nhave created. \n  \nThe ghouls encountered, excepting \nDenjin and Silyna are all standard \ncreatures. \n \nGhoul: CR 1; Medium-sized undead; \nHD 2d12; hp 13; Init +2; Spd 30 ft.; \nAC 14; Atk +3 melee \n(1d6+1+paralysis bite), +0 melee \n(1d3+1+Paralysis clawsx2); SA \nparalysis, create spawn; SQ undead, \n+2 turn resistance; AL CE; SV Fort \n+0, Ref +2, Will +5; Str 13, Dex 15, \nCon -, Int 13, Wis 14, Cha 16. \n Skills: Climb +6, Escape Artist \n+7, Hide +7, Intuit Direction +3, \nJump +6, Listen +7, Move Silently \n+7, Search +6, Spot +7.

However, if \nSilyna or Denjin escape, \nthey will eventually return \nto wreak havoc and get their \nrevenge on Lavender \nSprings and the PCs (if they \nare still around).  If this last \nscenario occurs, it is \nperfectly possible that if the \nparty ever passes through \nthis area again the town of \nLavender Spring will be \nrazed and overrun by \nghouls. \n \nExpanding the Adventure \n \nIf the GM chooses to he can \neasily add many hooks to \nexpand the adventure \nand/or make it a recurring \ntheme in his campaign. \n Some of the things that \ncould be expanded include:  \n\n• Who are what is the \n“dark force(s) behind Silyna’s \npowers? \n\n• Silyna could be part of a \nbroader cult who worship a \nghoul god and seek to create \na world populated by ghouls, \nwith living people being \ntreated like cattle for their \nfeeding. \n\nFEAST OR FAMINE\n\nScaling the \nAdventure \n\n \nAs written, house of \nghouls is most \nsuitable for parties \nof 3rd – 5th level. \nHowever, a few \nadjustments can be \nmade to make it \nsuitable for other \nlevels.  For 1st or 2nd\nlevel character, \nSilyna and Denjin \nbecome normal \nghouls and the PCs \nonly ever meet one \nor two ghouls at a \ntime.  For characters \nof a higher level, \nSilyna and Denjin \ntransform into \nghasts with suitable \ncharacter levels.  As \nwell DMs can \nincrease the number \nof ghouls \nencountered to \nbetter challenge the \nlevel of the PCs.\n\n MIDGARD: Online d20 Adventures: http://www.rpg-e.com/enworld/midgard/ \n\n\n\n \n \n\n \n\nFEAST OR FAMINE\n\n MIDGARD: Online d20 Adventures: http://www.rpg-e.com/enworld/midgard/ \n\n\n\nOpen Game License \n \nThe following text is the property of Wizards of the Coast, Inc. and is Copyright 2000 Wizards of the \nCoast, Inc (\"Wizards\").

Jacob Gabberson came from a long line of \nmetal smiths. Jacob was quite an artisan himself. In his younger years he was not satisfied with \nthe life of a smithy and tried his hand at adventuring. By mid age Jacob had acquired enough \nwealth to build a keep for him self. He hired the best Dwarven craftsmen.  \n Jacob had quite an industry growing with 4 huge forges in his keep he hired only the best \nsmithies money could buy. This was not enough for Jacob though. He wanted harder, better \nmetal so he hired a wizard named Kyle Farland as an alchemist to experiment with the metal. \nJacob and Kyle became the best of friends after some success and Kyle soon moved his \nmistress into the keep. Kyle’s mistress Ehlonna Basington was very fond of horses and riding so \nKyle bought her the finest steeds for her to manage. After a year of living in the keep they were to \nbe married. Only 3 short months after the engagement Ehlonna met with a fatal horse riding \naccident. \n Kyle went mad. He was obsessed, researching magic that could resurrect his dear sweet \nEhlonna. \nRumors started to be told. It was said that Kyle’s magic invited a bad element to the keep. \nSmithies and servants started leaving the keep. Poor Jacob was either to loyal to or to afraid of \nhis friend to confront him. Business plummeted. Eventually the outside world heard nothing at all \nfrom the keep and there are only rumors as to what happened within. \n This adventure is for 4 to 6 characters of 1st level. \n \n Adventure Hooks: The pc’s can be offered a handsome reward of 1,000 gp. to \ninvestigate the Keep by Nole Gabberson, Jacob’s nephew. To sweeten the pot Nole offers that \nthe pc’s can keep any spoils found in the keep. Nole’s intention is to reclaim the keep for his \nfamily. \n If there is a monk in the party the pc’s can be sent to find out what happened to Rahja, a \nmonk that was previously sent to investigate the keep. \n If there is a good cleric in the party the pc’s can go to investigate rumors of undead and \nother evil presences in the keep. \n\n\n\n \nArea A: Grappling Hook \n \n Standing at the front gates you see a hemp rope hanging from the top of the wall about \n15 ft. to your left. \n \nArea B: Trap Door \n \n In this area there is a trapdoor left open in the floor. The latter goes down some 30 ft. \n \nRoom 1: Kitchen Servants Quarters. \n  \n At the bottom of the latter you find yourself by the northeastern wall of a 40 ft. by 40 ft. \nroom. The ceiling is approximately 12 ft. high. There is a very large fireplace taking up the \nsoutheastern corner. There are also 3 doors in the room, one next to you on the northern most \npart of the eastern wall, one on the southern wall and one on the western wall. This appears to be \nsome sort of group room for women. There are approximately 16 bedrolls, the same amount of \nbroken chests and scattered women’s paraphernalia, such as hair brushes, broken mirrors, \nperfume and clothing. The room appears to have been ransacked and therefore has nothing of \nvalue.  \n \nArea F: Cave In \n \n This area is caved in. Any passage through the hallway is completely blocked. \n \nRoom 2: Kitchen Servants Quarters. \n \n This room is almost exactly opposite to room 1. This room too, appears to have been \nransacked. \n \n *One mirror in this room is intact though (Spot 15), (search 5). This is a minor wondrous \nitem. When you place a potion in front of it, the property of the potion is revealed as with an \nidentify spell. The item is limited by how many times it may be used. There are 11 charges left. \nOnce they are used the mirror shatters. \n \nRoom 3: Kitchen \n \n This room is obviously the kitchen. Its dimensions are 30 ft. by 80 ft.

Everything is thrown about chaotically and there are \nseveral tables that have been smashed. \n \nRoom 4: Grand Hallway. \n \n This area is some sort of grand hallway. It boasts a width of 20 ft. and is approximately \n60 ft. long. There are two doors, one on either side of the hallway, around 25 ft. from where you \nstand. Suddenly as you get your bearings you hear the rattle of chains and a horrific moaning. \nOut of the darkness of the end of the hallway you see a luminous humanoid figure floating slightly \noff the ground. As the figure comes towards you it crys “Leave here, leave here at once! This \nplace is truly cursed.” \n\n  *The figure continues to say this all the way up the hallway. Once the pc’s are \nwithin 5 ft. of the figure it disappears. Figures movement rate 15 ft.  \n\n \n\n\n\nRoom 5: Armory I \n \nThis room is obviously an armory. It is 50 ft. by 60 ft. The only door you see is the one which you \ncame in. In the northern portion of the room there are 40  human-sized armor stands. There are \nonly 6 suits still in tact; 3 studded leather, 2 chain mail and one suit of splint mail. To the south \nare dozens of weapon racks. These too, supply slim pickings. The only weapons that are still \ngood enough to sell are; 4 long swords, 2 short swords, and 1 rapier. In the back there is an \nentire rack of halberd heads but the wooden shafts are too rotten to be used. \n \nRoom 6: Pantry \n \n This room is filled with shelves and containers. There are 5 rows of two-sided shelves, 5 \nft. wide 12 ft. long and spaced about 5 ft. from one another. The room is 60 ft. long from north to \nsouth. An abnormal shape makes it 40 ft. wide on the northern half and 50 ft. wide on the \nsouthern half. The extra space creates room for another 15 ft. long shelf on in the southeastern \ncorner. There is another door directly across the room from you. Suddenly you hear a rustle and \na gnawing from the other side of the room.  \n \n *If the pc’s investigate read; \n \n \n As you walk between two rows of shelves you become aware of the smell of filth and rot \nand then you spot 4 rat-like animals that are 4 ft. long. They turn from rotten grain bags towards \nyou and let out a low feral growl. \n \n  *Dire Rats (6/5/3/2) \n Initiative:+3 \n Speed:40 ft. \n Armor Class:15, Touch: 14, Flat-footed:12 \n Base Attack: +0/Grapple -4 \n Attack: Bite +4 melee (1d4plus disease) \n Space/reach: 5ft. \n Special Attacks: Disease \n Special Qualities: Low-light vision, scent \n Saves: F. +3, R. +5, W +3 \n Skills: Climb +11, Hide +8, Listen +4, Move Silently +4, Spot +4, Swim +11 \n C.R.: 1/3 \n Treasure: none \n \nRoom 7: Dining Hall \n \n This room is colossal.

You can see 4 doors in this room, 2 on the east wall and 2 on the west wall. There are 7 \ngrand dining tables spread about this room. The largest of which is parallel to the back wall \nbehind the fireplace. You catch an eerie feeling as you notice 3 human skeletons slumped over \nthe table in the far southeastern corner of the room. \n \n *Once the pc’s travel 20 ft. into the room the skeletons animate. They wear rotten leather \narmor and carry short swords and light shields. \n  \n\n \n  \n \n \n \n\n\n\n \n*Human Skeleton (8/6/3) \n\n  \n Initiative: +5 \n Speed:30 ft. \n Armor Class:16, Touch: 11, Flat-footed:15 \n Base Attack: +0/Grapple +1 \n Attack: Short Sword +1 melee (1d6+1,19-20/x2) \n Space/reach: 5ft. \n Special Attacks: -  \n Special Qualities: Damage reduction 5/Bludgeoning, Dark vision, Immune to cold \n Saves: F. +0, R. +1, W +2 \n Skills \n C.R.: 1/3 \n Treasure: none \n \n \nRoom 8: Common Women’s Latrine \n \n There’s not much question as to what this room is used for.

The room is 40 ft. deep and 50 ft. wide. There doesn’t \nappear to be any other doors in the room. This keep seems to have treated their women very well \nthough.

Richards\nartwork by Stephen Walsh and Dennis Cramer • cartography by Diesel\n\n“Gorgoldand’s Gauntlet” is a D&D adventure suitable for four\n1st-level PCs. It takes place in a cave network in the side of a\n\ncliff overlooking a lake and can be inserted easily into any\ncampaign. The adventure can be adapted for characters of up to\n\n4th level, as described in the “Scaling the Adventure” sidebar.\n\nAdventure Background\nA gold dragon calling himself “Gorgoldand” (an anagram of\n“gold dragon”) converted a cave network into a testing ground\nto surreptitiously test the abilities of local adventuring bands.\nHe did this by posing (in human form) as a book collector and\nhiring each band to unearth a small cache of important tomes\nsaid to be stored in the deep recesses of a cave network\nknown as the “Gauntlet.” As the adventurers struggled through\nthe various traps and obstacles Gorgoldand had put in their\nway, the dragon observed their progress with the help of his\npseudodragon companion, Snooky. If the adventurers were\nultimately successful, Gorgoldand retrieved the tomes and\nallowed the heroes to keep the other treasure he’d stocked in\nthe Gauntlet from his hoard. Always included in the treasure\nwas a magic sword of his own design, through which he could\nkeep tabs on the band. Details on this magic sword are pro-\nvided in the “Hoardmaster” sidebar. Once the adventurers\nwere gone, Gorgoldand would restock the treasure room in\npreparation for the next adventuring band.\n\nRecently, however, Gorgoldand vanished. Lacking further\nguidance in the months since his master’s disappearance,\nSnooky has done his best to keep the testing facility running:\nfeeding the rust monsters and distributing copies of the maps\nthat lead adventurers to the Gauntlet. When a band of\njermlaine moved into the cave network a few months ago,\nSnooky grudgingly approved of the modifications they made\nto the Gauntlet, his love of practical jokes winning out over his\nsense of fair play. All in all, Snooky sees the jermlaine as a self-\nsustaining “upgrade” to his absent master’s Gauntlet.\n\nAdventure Synopsis\n“Gorgoldand’s Gauntlet” is a site-based adventure with a pre-\ndominance of puzzles and traps. The PCs discover a map lead-\ning to the Gauntlet and explore it looking for treasure. They\ntest their strength and wits against various traps and puzzles\ncreated by the gold dragon, as well as some slightly more devi-\nous and dangerous ones added by the scheming jermlaine. If\nthey make it all the way to the end of the Gauntlet, they’ll have\n\ngained access to a magic item that can have a significant\nimpact on their adventuring careers.\n\nFor the Players\nThe PCs are brought into the adventure by following a map\nthat leads to the Gauntlet. They could have found the map in a\ntreasure hoard during a previous adventure, or Snooky might\nhave simply left a copy at the PCs’ campsite as they slept. In\neither case, the map directs the PCs to the entrance of the\nGauntlet but provides no information on the interior of the\ncave network (and thus it is not provided as a player handout).\nThe map specifically mentions hidden treasure at the end of\nthe Gauntlet but does not indicate what that treasure is.\n\nThe Gauntlet\nUnless otherwise mentioned, the interior of the Gauntlet is\ndominated by rough floors and is unlit. PCs without darkvision\nneed to provide their own light sources.\n\n1. Cliff Ledge. The PCs’ map leads them to the top of a cliff\noverlooking a large lake.\n\nA metal piton hammered into the stone near the edge of the\ncliff gives silent testimony that others have been this way\nbefore, although the rope that would normally be attached to\nthe piton is missing. The narrow cave entrance to the Gauntlet\nis some 60 feet below the top of the cliff.\n\nThe jermlaine band removed the rope that the last adven-\nturing band used to climb down to the cave entrance. The PCs\ncan attach their own rope to climb down or do so without\nrope. Climb checks (DC 20 without rope or DC 10 with rope)\nare required from each character. Anyone falling from the\ncliff face plummets to the lake surface below. The cave\nentrance is 20 feet above the surface of the water. (The lake\nis 40 feet deep in that area.) PCs plunging from the top of the\ncliff fall a total of 80 feet before hitting water. Use the “Falling\ninto Water” rules on page 112–113 of the DUNGEON MASTER’s\nGuide to calculate falling damage, as appropriate.\n\nd Monsters     k Non-Player Characters (NPCs)     s Objects     c Settlements     a Traps\n\n\n\n4  may/june 2001\n\nGORGOLDAND’S GAUNTLET\n\n2. Cave Opening. The cave opening is a narrow, upright slit in\nthe side of the cliff wall. There is no illumination within.\n\nPCs must walk single file until reaching area 3. Make sure\nyou determine the party’s marching order to see who gets to\nexperience the trap just ahead.\n\n3. Spider Trap. The jermlaine have added some refinements to\nthe Gauntlet in the few short months since moving in. Along\nthe 20-foot-high cavern ceiling they’ve anchored a “spider\nweb” of crisscrossing rope lines. Two jermlaine stand on watch\nhere, ready to drop the husk of a large spider onto the first\nPC who enters the cavern. Read or paraphrase the following\nto the player of the lead character:\n\nAlong the north wall of the cavern is a secret door. The\nsecret door opens to a passageway that leads to a set of four\nholding pits in area 16 and the jermlaine central lair in area 17.\nIf the dust of sneezing and choking trap is triggered (see\nbelow), elves do not get their normal chance of detecting this\nsecret door merely by passing within 5 feet of it. This restric-\ntion remains in effect until the magical dust cloud settles to the\nground 5d4 rounds after being triggered. If the Trap is not\ntriggered, or once the dust has settled, elves have their nor-\nmal chances of noticing the secret door.\n\nTrap (EL 2): You might want to allow PCs in the front half\nof the group a Spot check (DC 20) to see the ropes attached\nto the spider. If the characters fail this check, the PCs auto-\nmatically strike first, as the spider is just a hollow husk shed by\nits previous owner and thus does not actually attack.\nHowever, the jermlaine have filled the husk with a packet of\ndust of sneezing and choking taken from a slain adventurer.\nAnyone inflicting damage on the dessicated spider husk with a\npiercing or slashing weapon rips it open and flings the magi-\ncal dust in a 10-foot radius that fills the room. \na Dust of Sneezing and Choking Trap: CR 2; Fortitude save\n\nnegates (DC 15; initial 2d6 temporary Constitution, secondary\n1d6 temporary Constitution); Search (DC 15); Disable Device\n(DC 15).\n\nCreature (EL 1/2): After loosing the spider husk on the PCs,\nthe two jermlaine hide in crevices in the ceiling. PCs trying to\nspot the jermlaine must make a successful Spot skill check\nopposed by the creatures’ Hide skill checks. If the PCs’ Listen\nskill checks are higher than the jermlaine’s Move Silently skill\nchecks, they hear ratlike chitterings reminiscent of laughter. If\ndiscovered, these jermlaine skitter off into secret passageways\ncarved into the cavern wall. The tunnels are much too small\nfor the PCs to follow. These passageways are near ceiling level\nand wind back and forth before spilling out into area 16.\nd Jermlaine (2): CR 1/4; Diminutive Monstrous Humanoid (1\n\nft. tall); HD 1/2d8; hp 2 each; Init +2 (Dex); Spd 40 ft.; AC 14\n(+2 Dex, +2 size); Atk +0 melee (1d3–2, tiny club) or +2 ranged\n(1d4–2, small halfspear); SQ darkvision 60 ft., +15 racial bonus\nto Hide and Move Silently checks, +5 racial bonus to Listen\nchecks; AL N; SV Fort +0, Ref +4, Will +4; Str 6, Dex 15, Con\n10, Int 10, Wis 17, Cha 9.\n\nSkills: Animal Empathy +2, Handle Animal +2, Hide +22,\nListen +10, Move Silently +20, Open Lock +5, Spot +4. Feats:\nSkill Focus (Hide).\n\nPossessions: Tiny club, small halfspear.\n\n4. Trapped Room. Once again, the passageway narrows, forc-\ning travel in single file. Dangling from the cavern ceiling is a\nthin rope, ending in a loose lasso made from hair along the\nground. The words “PUT FUT HEER” has been scrawled in\nchalk in the middle of the open lasso—obviously, this is some-\none’s childish idea of a snare.\n\nThe area immediately beyond the rope lasso snare is a pit\ntrap (see Trap below). The jermlaine added the simplistic and\nblatantly obvious snare trap to draw attention away from the\nreal danger. The rope lasso is only weakly attached to the cav-\nern ceiling and can be pulled down easily. (A PC cannot use it\nto prevent falling into the pit.)\n\nTrap (EL 1): Gorgoldand created a simple pit trap here to test\nthe adventurers. Two hinged trap doors open inward to a 10-\nfoot pit if more than 50 pounds is placed on them. The\njermlaine have since modified the pit, wedging the snapped-off\nblades of a few daggers into cracks in the stone pit floor.\nFurthermore, the devious little pests have lined the pit with a\nrare underground moss with effects similar to poison ivy. \n\nThe narrow passageway widens into a cavern. A hairy, multi-\nlegged form drops down on you from the shadows above!\n\nScaling the Adventure\nAlthough this adventure is designed for 1st-level PCs, it can be\nrun for 2nd- to 4th-level PCs by changing the strength and\nnumber of opponents and traps. Use the “Encounter Level\nTable” at the end of the adventure as a baseline for modifying\nthe adventure in the manner suggested below:\n\n2nd-level PCs: The adventure, as written, is a bit too easy\nfor 2nd-level PCs. Add one jermlaine to each of the three\njermlaine encounters, and deepen the pit trap in area 4 to 20\nfeet. Give the merrow a single level of warrior, have the paral-\nysis minefield deal 1d3 points of damage on a misstep, and add\none more animated statue to area 14. If you use the optional\nencounter at the end of the adventure, give Breagar the dwarf\nanother level of rogue.\n\n3rd-level PCs: Run the adventure with the changes discussed\nabove, plus the following additional changes: Give the merrow a\n\nsingle level of fighter (instead of a level of warrior), have the\nparalysis minefield in area 11 deal 1d4 points of damage on a\nmisstep, and add another animated skeleton statue to area 14\n(four statues total). Also, make the statues stone, which gives\nthem a Hardness of 8. Additionally, coat the fishhooks in area\n6 with a mild venom (DC 14; initial and secondary damage 1d4\ntemporary Strength). Finally, add another 1st-level rogue (with\nstatistics identical to Rashanda’s) to the final encounter.\n\n4th-level PCs: Run the adventure with the changes dis-\ncussed above, but make the following additional modifications:\nDeepen the pit trap in area 4 to 30 feet deep, give the mer-\nrow two levels of fighter, have the paralysis minefield in area\n11 deal 1d6 points of damage on a misstep, and add another\nstone statue to area 14 (five statues total). Coat the fishhooks\nin area 6 with poison (DC 18; initial and secondary damage of\n1d6 temporary Strength). Finally, make Rotvil a 3rd-level bar-\nbarian if you use the final encounter.\n\n\n\nJumping over the pit trap, whether it’s been activated or\nnot, requires a successful Jump check. (The pit is 10 feet\nacross.) A running jump is possible as long as the dust has\ncleared in area 3; otherwise, entering the dust cloud again\nforces another Fortitude check to avoid its hazards.\na Pit Trap: CR 1/2; no attack roll necessary (1d6); +10 melee\n\n(1d4 spikes for 1d4 points of damage per successful hit); Reflex\nsave (DC 20) avoids; Search (DC 21); Disable Device (DC 20).\na Moss Trap: CR 1/2; no attack roll necessary; 1d2 points of\n\ntemporary Dexterity damage; Fortitude save (DC 16) negates.\nCreatures (EL 1): To add insult to injury, when the PCs crawl\n\nback out of the pit (or while jumping over it) four jermlaine\napproach from the east. Each throws a spear at the PCs and\nthen retreats, giggling all the way. PCs who make a successful\nSpot skill check (DC 15) see that each jermlaine also carries\nwhat appears to be a small shepherd’s crook.\nd Jermlaine (4): hp 3 each; see area 3 for full statistics.\n\n5. Chasm Entrance. The boxed text below assumes the PCs are\nin hot pursuit of the spear-throwing jermlaine. If this is not the\ncase, modify the text accordingly:\n\nTrap (EL 1): Across this area of the Gauntlet the jermlaine\nhave hung hundreds of fishhooks on slim lines woven from\nhair. The fishhooks are staggered at various heights ranging\nfrom 2–6 feet from the cavern floor; the foot-tall jermlaine\nrush by at full speed confident that they’ll avoid entanglement.\nYou might want to allow the PCs a Spot check (DC 20) to see\nthe trap as they chase the jermlaine. (The DC is 15 if the PCs\nproceed with caution.)\n\nA successful Dexterity check (DC 20) is needed to get free\nof the fishhooks; each unsuccessful attempt deals 1 point of\ndamage. Optionally, any PC not entangled can cut an entangled\ncompanion free with a slashing weapon. The trap can be dis-\nabled with a successful Disable Device check.\na Fishhook Trap: CR 1; +8 melee (1d4+1) and entangle as the\n\nspell; Reflex save negates entangle effect (DC 20); Search (DC\n14); Disable Device (DC 10).\n\n6. Chasm. A 20-foot wide chasm cuts across the dungeon cor-\nridor. The sounds of splashing water emanate from the chasm\nbottom. On the stone floor across the expanse, a visored hel-\nmet sits upon the ground.\n\nCloser examination of the chasm reveals some recent\njermlaine modifications. A tiny piton hammered into the stone\non the southwest side supports a thin thread woven from hair\n(most of it human); this thread acts as a zip-line for the\njermlaine, who “ride” the line using their crooks down to a\nsmall hole in the ledge on the southeast side of the chasm. A\nsimilar setup exists for sliding down from the northeast sur-\nface to the northwest ledge. The threads do not support more\nthan 25 pounds.\n\nThe jermlaine slide down the zip-lines to a hidey-hole in the\nsoutheast ledge; this connects to a set of jermlaine-sized stairs\nleading up to a small hole in the cavern floor covered by a\nvisored helmet. From inside the helmet, a single jermlaine can\nuse a tiny blowgun against the PCs under the benefit of 90%\ncover, providing a +10 bonus to AC. The blowgun darts deal 1\npoint of damage each; there are two dozen darts stored inside\nthe helmet. Once the PCs make it across the chasm, they can\nsimply lift the visored helmet up off the ground, exposing the\nnarrow jermlaine tunnel and stairway below. At this point, the\njermlaine retreat, using a tiny passageway that leads to their\nmain lair in area 17. The PCs are unable to navigate the tiny\njermlaine passageways.\n\nA similar setup exists along the north side of the chasm. The\njermlaine-sized stairs lead up to a hole in the floor at the\nnorthwest side of the chasm; this hole is covered by a small\nrock. At the bottom of the stairs is a side-shaft that leads back\nto the jermlaine den in area 17.\n\nThe chasm is 20 feet wide and angles down to the lake\nbelow. The chasm is only 15 feet wide at the level of the\njermlaine ledges, some 10 feet below the dungeon floor and an\nequal distance above the surface of the water. PCs can elect\nto climb the north or south walls of the chasm; jump the chasm\n(a running jump is not possible unless the fishhooks in area 5\nare cut down); or climb down the chasm, swim across, and\nclimb back up the east side of the chasm. See the Player’s\nHandbook for rules governing Climb and Swim skill checks.\nPCs falling into the water take no damage from the fall but\nmight drown if they are wearing heavy armor; they might also\nfind a nasty surprise waiting for them in the dark waters of the\nlake (see area 7).\n\n5\n\nGORGOLDAND’S GAUNTLET\n\nAs you pursue the tiny tormentors, you see a chasm ahead.\nThe little humanoids dive over the ledge feet-first, one at a\ntime, with their crooks held out above them. Suddenly, you\nbrush up against several slim strings and feel the tug of\nsharp metal on your face and arms!\n\n\n\n7. Underwater Cave. This large cavern is completely sub-\nmerged and pitch black. The PCs need darkvision or some type\nof magical illumination to see the cavern’s contents: a 16-foot\nwooden plank (originally positioned by Gorgoldand at the west\nend of the chasm, later pitched into the water by the jermlaine)\nand a few scattered bones (human and jermlaine). Hidden\nunder a large rock is a canvas sack filled with 750 sp and 250\ngp. A successful Strength check (DC 18) is required to move\nthe rock.\n\nCreature (EL 2): Since Gorgoldand first set up his Gauntlet,\na merrow, outcast from his own tribe, has moved into the\nunderwater cavern. Depending on the relative strength of the\nparty, the merrow might be present during the adventure or\nout hunting fish in the lake. If present, he hears anyone splash-\ning into his cavern from above and approaches to investigate.\nHe attacks immediately upon discovering intruders. The\njermlaine are aware of the merrow’s lair and avoid the water\nat all costs.\nd Merrow (Aquatic Ogre): CR 2; Large Giant (9 ft. tall); HD\n\n4d8+8; hp 22; Init –1 (Dex); Spd 30 ft., swim 40 ft.; AC 16 (–1\nsize, –1 Dex, +5 natural, +3 hide); Atk +8 melee (1d8+7, long-\nspear); AL CE; SV Fort +6; Ref +0; Will +1; Str 21, Dex 8, Con\n15, Int 6, Wis 10, Cha 7.\n\nSkills: Climb +4, Listen +2, Spot +2. Feats: Weapon Focus\n(longspear).\n\n8. Underwater Entrance. This passage is about 10 feet wide and\nleads from area 7 to the lake. The entrance is 10 feet below the\nwater’s surface and cannot be seen from above the waterline.\nPCs investigating the cliff wall from below the waterline can\nfind this passageway with a successful Spot check (DC 12).\n\n9. Pseudodragon Lair. Snooky the pseudodragon lairs atop a\nhigh ledge along the cavern overlooking the eastern side of the\nchasm. The lair is engulfed in shadows and can’t be seen by the\nPCs unless they can levitate, fly, or otherwise gain access to\nthe cavern ceiling.\n\nA secret passage at the back of Snooky’s lair leads to a\nshadowy overhang in area 11.\n\nCreature (EL 1): Snooky stays out of sight, not wishing to\nreveal his presence. Once the PCs pass by area 6, he surrep-\ntitiously follows them, keeping track of their progress without\naiding them or revealing himself.\nd Snooky, Pseudodragon: CR 1; Tiny Dragon (3 ft. long); HD\n\n2d12+2; hp 17; Init +0; Spd 15 ft., fly 60 ft. (good); AC 18 (+2\nsize, +6 natural); Atk +4 melee (1d3 and poison, sting), –1 melee\n(1, bite); SA poison; SQ see invisibility, telepathy, immunities,\nSR 19; AL NG; SV Fort +4, Ref +3, Will +4; Str 11, Dex 11, Con\n13, Int 10, Wis 12, Cha 10.\n\nSkills: Hide +8 (+16 in forests and overgrown areas), Intuit\nDirection +3, Listen +5, Search +2, Spot +5. Feat: Alertness.\n\n6  may/june 2001\n\nGORGOLDAND’S GAUNTLET\n\nThe Gauntlet\nOne square = 5 feet\n\n\n\nTreasure: Snooky’s treasure consists of two small wooden\nboxes of nails, three metal gauntlets, two tin spoons, a belt\npouch containing 38 gp (which Snooky doles out to the rust\nmonsters in area 1o), a single leather glove (a left-handed glove\nof storing), a jar of Keoghtom’s ointment, and a dozen copies\nof the map the PCs used to locate the Gauntlet.\n\n10. Rust Monster Lair. This room is blocked from side to side\nby a low wall of mortared bricks. The wall stands 8 feet tall,\nwhile the ceiling of the cavern is 15 feet high.\n\nPCs should have little difficulty climbing over the wall; it’s\nlow enough that a boost up by a friend should get even the\nshortest PC to the top. Once the PCs have reached the top of\nthe wall, read or paraphrase the following:\n\nThe door inscription is a riddle, which reads:\n\nSPELLED FRONT TO BACK, IT’S A PERSON’S NAME\nOR A PROTECTIVE GUARD, FOR CERTAIN.\nSPELLED BACK TO FRONT, IT’S WHAT YOU DO\nWITH A BOW, BLANK PAGE, OR CURTAIN.\n\nBelow the door are four wooden dials, each with four dif-\nferent letters carved on its surface. The answer to the riddle\nis therefore a four-letter word, which must be spelled out with\nthe four dials. The diagram above shows which letters appear\non each dial. The answer to the riddle is “WARD.”\n\nCreatures (EL 5): Even if the players solve the riddle imme-\ndiately, the PCs are attacked by the two\nrust monsters hiding under the brick shelf\njutting out from the wall. The rust mon-\nsters attack before the PCs can turn the\nfour dials into the correct configuration.\nThe rust monsters are hungry, but they\nhave been trained to wait until the PCs\nstep on the floor of the cavern before\nattacking. If the PCs peek over the edge of\nthe overhang and discover the rust mon-\nsters, the creatures attack immediately.\nd Rust Monsters (2): CR 3; Medium-\n\nsize Aberration (5 ft. long); HD 5d8+5; hp\n25, 21; Init +3 (Dex); Spd 40 ft.; AC 18 (+3\nDex, +5 natural); Atk +3 melee (rust, 2\nantennae), –2 melee (1d3, bite); SA rust; SQ\nscent; AL N; SV Fort +2, Ref +4, Will +5;\nStr 10, Dex 17, Con 13, Int 2, Wis 13, Cha 8.\n\nSkills: Listen +9, Spot +9. Feat: Alert-\nness.\n\nTactics: The rust monsters head for the\nlargest concentration of metal (such as a\nwell-armored PC). Being rather ungainly,\nthey cannot climb onto the shelf sticking\nout of the wall, although their antennae can\nreach PCs perched there. PCs not wishing\nto lose most of their metallic armor and\n\nequipment can climb back onto the wall, out of the rust mon-\nsters’ reach, while they puzzle out the solution to the riddle.\n\nOnce the four dials are in the correct configuration, the\ndoor swings outward into the next room, supported on hinges\nat the top instead of at the side. The fact that the entire door\nis made of wood prevents the rust monsters from corroding it\nand gaining access to other parts of the Gauntlet.\n\nIf the players cannot figure out the riddle, the door must be\nopened through other means. It can easily be opened from the\nother side, where the locking mechanisms are visible.\ns Locked Wooden Door: 1.5 in. thick; Hardness 5; hp 15;\n\nBreak (DC 18); Open Lock (DC 25).\n\n11. Paralysis Minefield. The floor of the cavern is smooth,\nalthough the walls remain jagged stone. Twenty feet ahead, the\nfloor is divided into 160 squares, each a 2-foot by 2-foot metal\nplate, forming an 8 square by 20 square grid.\n\nBy the time the PCs arrive in this part of the Gauntlet,\nSnooky the pseudodragon has crawled through the secret pas-\nsageway in the back of his lair to perch on a shadowy over-\nhang looking into this room. Using his telepathic powers, he\ncontacts the PCs:\n\nTrap (EL 2): Each time a PC steps onto a square, Snooky\n(true to his word) informs her of how many trapped squares\nare adjacent to that one. The diagram on the next page shows\nthe locations of the traps and the number of traps adjacent to\neach square, so you can relay the information, square by\n\n7\n\nGORGOLDAND’S GAUNTLET\n\nThe wall is 1 foot thick. Behind and built into the wall is a 5-\nfoot-high shelf that runs parallel to the floor. An odd wooden\ndoor is set into the far end of the cavern. Words have been\ncarved into the door, but at this distance it’s impossible to\nmake out what they say.\n\nSuddenly, a voice speaks in your head. “Many of the squares\nahead are trapped,” it says. “I will not tell you where the\ntraps are located, but as you stand upon a square, I will tell\nyou how many trapped squares are adjacent to that one. The\nrest is up to you.”\n\n\n\n8  may/june 2001\n\nGORGOLDAND’S GAUNTLET\n\nsquare, to the players. A copy of The Minefield diagram (with-\nout the solution) can be given to the players so they can track\ntheir characters’ progress, filling in the information on the\nsquares as the PCs move down the corridor.\n\nAnyone stepping on a trapped square takes 1 point of elec-\ntrical damage and must make a successful Fortitude saving\nthrow (DC 20) or be paralyzed. Triggering a trapped square\ndoes not make that square “safe,” as anyone else subsequently\nstepping onto that square also runs the risk of paralysis. A\nparalyzed PC that remains standing on a trapped square is not\nautomatically paralyzed again when the initial paralyzation\nwears off; she can step freely from that square. If the PC steps\nback onto the trapped square at a later time, however, she\nmust make another Fortitude save to avoid paralysis.\n\nThe easiest way for the PCs to get through the minefield is\nto write down how many traps each square is adjacent to. Any\ntime the PCs stand on a square that is adjacent to no traps,\nthey know that it is safe to stand on each of the (up to) eight\nsquares touching that one. The way the traps have been posi-\ntioned, it is possible for the PCs to make it through the grid-\nwork without losing a member of the party to paralysis.\n\nClimbing along the natural stone walls requires a Climb\ncheck (DC 20). If a climbing PC falls, determine which square\nshe lands on, as the PC might need to make a Fortitude save\nto avoid paralysis.\n\nOnce the PCs have made it past the trap they come to a\nstandard wooden door. The door is unlocked, and opens out-\nward into the next room.\n\na Electrified, Paralyzing Floor: CR 2; 1 point of damage and\nparalysis for 3d10+30 minutes per square contacted; Fortitude\nsave negates paralysis (DC 20).\n\nCreatures (EL 1): If the PCs take longer than 5 minutes to\ncross the room, four jermlaine come to investigate. The four\njermlaine descend the stairs on the other side of the door (they\nhave discovered the secret of the stairs through trial and\nerror, though they can’t read the message written on them—\nsee area 12 for details) and push it open enough for two of\nthem at a time to hurl javelins at paralyzed PCs. (Treat the\njermlaine as having three-quarters cover from the door.) The\njermlaine hoot and taunt the PCs as they struggle through the\nroom, but they leave if any of the PCs get close enough to\njump into the doorway or if they run out of javelins, whichever\nhappens first.\nd Jermlaine (4): hp 3 each; see area 3 for full statistics.\n\n12. Stairway. Beyond the door is a narrow corridor. Unlike the\nrest of the natural cave network seen so far, this passageway\nis carved into the rock; the floor, ceiling, and walls are smooth. \n\nEach of the ascending steps has a single word engraved on\nits front face; the words all glow slightly, making them easy to\nread even in the gloom of the corridor. Beginning at the bot-\ntom step and reading up, the words say:\n\nIT SEEMS EVERY SECOND OR THIRD TIME I STEP AWAY,\nFATE IS THERE, WITHOUT A DOUBT, TO TRAP MY COURSE.\n\nThe Minefield\nOne square = 2.5 feet\n\nThe Minefield Solution\n\n\n\nThe solution to this stairway is found by reading every third\nword; doing so reveals the message “EVERY THIRD STEP IS A\nTRAP.” If the PCs avoid every third step, they can ascend to\nthe upper level without incident.\n\nTrap (EL 2): Anyone stepping on one of the third steps trig-\ngers a magic trap. Instantly, an illusionary sheet of flames\nwhooshes up from the step, obscuring anyone or anything on\nthat step from view. At the same time, the person or object on\nthe step is teleported to a holding pit in area 16. The next\nround the flames automatically extinguish, leaving nothing\nbehind. Gorgoldand’s intention was to make it seem as if the\nperson or object triggering the trap was instantly incinerated,\ntaking him or her out of the picture without actually causing\nthe individual any real harm.\n\nEach trapped step can be activated more than once, but only\na total of four victims (or objects) can be claimed by this trap.\nSee area 16 for details.\na Teleportation Trap: CR 2; teleport to area 16; Reflex save\n\navoids (DC 27); Search (DC 25); Disable Device (DC 32).\n\n13. Gorgoldand’s Den. At the top of the stairs is a small room\nwith a metal door set into the far wall. Hanging on the walls\nare various weapons mounted on wooden plaques.\n\nThe weapons might be unfamiliar to some PCs, as they’re\nnot weapons chosen by most adventurers. Mounted on a\nplaque of dark wood is a pair of siangham; the plaque is\nengraved: “PA’S HAND WEAPONS, GUTSTICKERS.”\n\nOn the second wooden plaque is a metal gauntlet (right\nhand) with spikes protruding from the knuckles. The legend\n“PA’S GAUNTLET, FIST OF PAIN” is carved into the plaque.\n\nOn the wall across from the other two plaques is a longer\none, upon which is hung a falchion. The inscription below it\nreads: “PA’S SWORD, ISLET’S LAUGHTER.”\n\nAnyone touching the doorknob of the metal door activates a\npermanent magic mouth that says: “Not without the password,\nyou don’t. What’s the password?” This recurs any time the door\nis touched without first saying the password. The password, of\n\ncourse, is in plain sight of the PCs, written on the falchion’s\nplaque inscription. By rearranging the spaces between the let-\nters to form new words, “PA’S SWORD, ISLET’S LAUGHTER”\nbecomes “PASSWORD IS LET SLAUGHTER.”\n\nThe door is locked. The PCs need only speak the words “let\nslaughter” in Common before opening the door. Optionally,\nthey can try picking the lock or bashing their way through the\ndoor, but this is a difficult process.\ns Iron Door: 2 in. thick; Hardness 10; hp 60; Break (DC 28);\n\nOpen Lock (DC 24).\nTreasure: Any of the weapons can be taken from the\n\nplaques and used by the PCs. The two siangham, spiked metal\ngauntlet, and falchion are all +1 weapons. The sound of ocean\nwaves breaking upon a beach emanates from the falchion\nwhenever its hilt is grasped.\n\nIf the weapons are examined using a detect magic spell,\neach one emanates Transmutation magic. While the PCs are\nfree to use any of these weapons while inside the Gauntlet,\nonce the weapons are brought outside the cave complex they\nautomatically teleport back to the plaques in this room. If the\nplaques are removed or destroyed, the weapons reappear on\nthe floor of the chamber.\n\n14. Skeleton Trap.\n\n9\n\nGORGOLDAND’S GAUNTLET\n\nBeyond the door is a short passageway leading to an open\narchway 20 feet high. The 30-foot by 40-foot room beyond\nsports a 25-foot-high ceiling and is lit by golden-hued con-\ntinual flame spells. Four columns stretch from floor to ceil-\ning. The entire chamber has been carved from stone and\npainstakingly smoothed and polished, giving the room the\nappearance of a fancy hall in a lord’s manor rather than part\nof a dungeon. Flanking a mirror mounted to the far wall are\nfour skeletons, each grasping a short sword. Letters are\ncarved into the wall above the mirror, but at this distance\nyou can’t make them out.\n\nSide View\nOne square = 5 feet\n\n\n\n10  may/june 2001\n\nGORGOLDAND’S GAUNTLET\n\nWhen the PCs enter the room, they can make a Spot skill\ncheck (DC 20) to notice a set of narrow grooves rising verti-\ncally from the floor along each side of the doorway leading\ninto the room. As they approach the center of the room, they\ncan tell that the skeletons and their swords seem to be carved\nfrom white stone. (The statues are actually carved from wood\nand painted white, but their swords are made of stone.) Their\nskulls are smooth where the eye sockets should be. The letters\ncarved above the mirror read “TIRIANISPORITIUS.” Further,\nanyone gazing into the mirror sees an exact reflection of the\nroom, except that the room in the mirror shows a pile of loose\ncoins, gems, and several weapons scattered upon the floor,\nwith a set of six large tomes stacked in the corner.\n\nThe mirror is a magic transport device, activated by speak-\ning the proper command word. The command word can be\ngleaned by noting the eyeless skeletal statues and applying that\nto the word carved above the mirror. Removing the “I’s” from\nthe word “Tirianisporitius” gives the true command word:\n“transportus.”\n\nIf the command word is spoken within 15 feet of the mirror,\nthe mirror’s image darkens to an inky black and acts as a\ndimension door that leads straight to the treasure room in area\n15. A similar mirror graces the interior of the treasure room,\nwhich works in the same manner. The treasure room is other-\nwise shielded against teleportation magic.\n\nTrap (EL 1): Touching the mirror or statues without first\nuttering the command word causes a portcullis to crash down\nin the doorway (along the grooves), blocking escape from the\nroom. Anyone standing directly under the portcullis when it\nfalls must make a successful Reflex saving throw (DC 15) or be\nstruck for 2d6 points of damage and pinned. A PC pinned\nunder the portcullis must make a Strength check or an Escape\nArtist check (DC 20) to extricate himself. A maximum of three\n(pinned or unpinned) PCs can help lift the portcullis high\nenough to allow others to crawl underneath it. (Use the “Aid\nAnother” rule in the Player’s Handbook.)\na Portcullis Trap: CR 2; +10 melee (2d6 points of damage\n\nto PC underneath, blocks passage); Search (DC 16); Disable\nDevice (DC 20).\n\nCreatures (EL 3): As the portcullis falls, the two skeletal stat-\nues farthest from the mirror animate and attack everyone in\nthe room. (The two statues adjacent to the mirror are inani-\nmate.) The statues fight until they are destroyed, the intruders\nare slain, the intruders leave the room, or the correct com-\nmand word is spoken aloud. (In all but the former case, they\nimmediately cease battle and resume their original positions.)\nThe statues do not leave this room of their own accord under\nany conditions. Despite having no eyes or eye sockets, the\nstatues act as if they have 60-foot darkvision. Despite their\nskeletal appearance, the statues are not undead and thus can-\nnot be turned.\nd Animated Statues (2): CR 2; Medium-Size Construct; HD\n\n2d10; hp 12 each; Init +0; Spd 40 ft.; AC 15 (+5 natural); Atk +2\nmelee (1d6+1, stone shortsword); SQ construct, hardness 5; AL\nN; SV Fort +0, Ref +0, Will -5; Str 12, Dex 10, Con —, Int —,\nWis 1, Cha 1.\n\n15. Treasure Room. The interior of this 30-foot by 40-foot\nroom is lit with continual flame spells. The ceiling is 25 feet\nhigh and supported by four pillars, and the entire room is\ncarved from stone. Scattered about the floor are loose heaps\nof coins and gems, with the occasional weapon poking out of\na pile. Six large tomes are stacked in one corner.\n\nOne round after the PCs enter the room, the scattered\ntreasure starts to move, telekinetically dragging across the\nfloor of the room counterclockwise, as if drawn by an invisi-\nble whirlpool. The objects move faster and faster around a\ncentral point in the middle of the room, forming an upward-\nthrusting pillar of treasure. Gradually, this pillar takes on a\nvaguely draconic shape with a head, tail, four legs, and a pair\nof short wings.\n\nCreature (EL 4): The “coin dragon” attacks everyone in the\nroom, slapping opponents with its tail or wings. In addition, the\ncoin dragon can shoot a barrage of coins and gems from its\nmouth like a breath weapon. After firing a barrage, the coin\ndragon must telekinetically reabsorb the coins and gems back\ninto its body the following round, so it is restricted to a tail- or\nwing-slap attack the round after using its breath weapon.\n\nHoardmaster\nGorgoldand stocks the treasure room of his Gauntlet with\nvarious treasures, but one thing he’s sure to include each\ntime is a Hoardmaster sword. Each Hoardmaster is a +1\nlongsword with a hilt carved to resemble a dragon’s head.\nTwo rubies take the place of the dragon’s eyes. These ruby\n“eyes” are actually scrying devices, allowing Gorgoldand to\nsee through them as if they were his own. This allows the gold\ndragon to keep tabs on the adventuring bands wise and pow-\nerful enough to make it to the end of his Gauntlet, for they\nmight prove useful to him some day.\n\nHoardmaster gets its name from its ability to create a coin\ndragon if placed within a loose pile of coins and gems. This\nallows a treasure hoard to more or less guard itself; details on\nthe coin dragon are provided in the description of area 15.\nWhoever places the sword with some treasure can later\nretrieve it without activating the coin dragon. Others are not\nso lucky. Of course, this means the PCs must choose between\n\nbringing Hoardmaster with them as a weapon or leaving it\nbehind to guard their other treasures. Gorgoldand doesn’t\nmind at all when adventurers leave their Hoardmasters\nbehind, as it allows him to scry their treasure for any inter-\nesting magical items. If he sees anything interesting, he’s not\nagainst using a teleport without error spell to show up and\nstudy the item of interest. Gorgoldand created the\nHoardmasters so that he would not trigger any coin dragon\nattacks himself. Of course, the gold dragon would never steal\nanything from the adventurers’ hoard.\n\nHoardmaster can detect coins once/day, upon command.\nThe sword points to the largest collection of coins within a\n60-foot radius, regardless of intervening walls, hidden pas-\nsages, or the like. The ability functions for 10 rounds each\ntime it is used.\n\nCaster Level: 12th; Prerequisites: Enchant Arms and\nArmor, scry, telekinesis, unseen servant; Market Price: 18,312\ngp; Weight: 4 lbs.\n\n\n\n11\n\nMost ordinary weapons do little or no damage to the coin\ndragon. Piercing and slashing weapons slide right through the\nloose objects in its “body,” doing no damage. A blunt weapon\nlike a mace or club might dislodge a handful of coins, but these\nare easily returned to the coin dragon the following round.\n(They are sucked back into the creature’s body telekinetically.)\n\nA dispel magic cast upon the creature causes the disparate\nobjects forming the dragon’s body to crash to the floor, leav-\ning the dragon “bodiless.” The creature reforms its “body” the\nfollowing round, but this allows PCs time to escape (possibly\nwith an item or two from the hoard). The coin dragon is not\npermanently destroyed until it loses all of its hit points.\n\nThe coin dragon never leaves its treasure room and natu-\nrally heals 3 hit points per day. PCs in combat with a coin\ndragon might find it necessary to do some damage, leave the\ntreasure room to heal up and prepare new spells, then con-\ntinue the assault later (possibly over the course of several\ndays, depending on the strength of the party).\nd Coin Dragon (1): CR 4; Medium-Size Construct (7 ft. long);\n\nHD 3d10; hp 18; Init +0; Spd 40 ft.; AC 14 (+4 natural); Atk +4\nmelee (1d6+2, tail slap or wing slap); SA breath weapon; SQ con-\nstruct, damage reduction 10/+1, resistances; AL N; SV Fort +0,\nRef +0, Will -5; Str 14, Dex 10, Con —, Int —, Wis 10, Cha 1.\n\nSA—Breath Weapon (Su): The coin dragon can breathe a 20-\nfoot cone of coins and gems that deals 1d8+2 points of dam-\nage to anyone in the area of effect; a successful Reflex save\n(DC 14) halves the damage. The breath weapon is usable only\nonce every other round.\n\nSQ—Construct: Immune to mind-influencing effects, poison,\ndisease, and similar effects. Not subject to critical hits, sub-\ndual damage, ability damage, energy drain, or death from mas-\nsive damage.\n\nSQ—Resistances (Ex): The coin dragon has acid, cold, elec-\ntricity, and fire resistance 5.\n\nTreasure: Once the coin dragon is slain, the PCs are free to\nrecover the treasure that made up its body, as well as the six\ntomes that Gorgoldand often used as an excuse to send heroes\ninto the Gauntlet in the first place. The tomes are all completely\nblank. (Gorgoldand, in his role as a human sage, would claim\nthat the writing was invisible, requiring a special set of magic\nspectacles to read.) The PCs are free to use the blank tomes\nas diaries, journals, for mapping, or as future spellbooks.\nBesides the tomes, the accumulated treasure breaks down to\n2,000 cp; 550 sp; 300 gp; 16 gemstones worth 250 gp, 100 gp\n\n(× 3), 50 gp (× 7), and 10 gp (× 5) respectively; two masterwork\ndaggers; a light mace; a scimitar; and Hoardmaster, a long-\nsword detailed in the sidebar (see adjacent page).\n\n16. Holding Pits. These holding pits are accessed by a secret\npassage in area 3. Anyone or anything activating the trap in\narea 12 is teleported without error into one of the four pits\n(pits A, B, C, and D, in that order). Once each pit has a victim\nor object within, it no longer functions as a teleport destination\nuntil such time as the pit is no longer occupied. The pits are 10\nfeet on all sides, carved into the stone floor of the cavern, and\ntopped with a 3-foot by 3-foot door of iron bars that opens\nout from the cage top.\n\nGorgoldand originally intended these pits as holding areas for\nadventurers who had fallen victim to his teleport trap in area 12.\nGorgoldand would escort these victims back to the cavern\nentrance and cast a lesser geas spell on them, compelling the\nadventurers to refrain from telling anyone else about the\nsecrets of the Gauntlet and Gorgoldand’s involvement.\n\nUnfortunately, the jermlaine soon discovered the secret\ndoor in area 3 and made their lair in a series of twisting pas-\nsages connected to the holding pits. The pits were put to good\nuse as jermlaine middens, and the vicious little creatures see\nno reason to stop the practice just because an occasional\nadventurer pops into existence inside their latrine pits!\n\nThe jermlaine slew the first adventurer that teleported into\ntheir latrine pit, shaved him bald, used his hair to weave their\nropes and nets, and feasted on him for a week. Snooky was\noutraged at this betrayal; up until then, he thought the jermlaine\nwere just playing elaborate, if somewhat dangerous, practical\njokes on those adventurers willing to try their hand at the\nGauntlet. Eventually, they agreed to a compromise: Snooky\nwould use his tail venom to put any victims who teleported into\nthe holding pits to sleep; the jermlaine would strip the victim of\nall possessions (except for some metal bits Snooky keeps),\nshave him bald, and bind the victim’s ankles and wrists. Then\nSnooky and the jermlaine would drag the helpless and uncon-\nscious captive back to the cavern entrance at area 2 to be dis-\ncovered by the rest of the adventuring band upon their return\nto the surface.\n\nThis agreement keeps everyone happy (with the possible\nexception of the victim). The jermlaine get to humiliate a mem-\nber of “the giant races” and acquire more hair for their ropes,\nwhile Snooky gets to play a practical joke on an adventurer\n\nGORGOLDAND’S GAUNTLET\n\n\n\n12  may/june 2001\n\nGORGOLDAND’S GAUNTLET\n\n(who, in all fairness, would have been slain if the teleport trap\nwas as lethal as Gorgoldand made it appear). The pseudodragon\nensures that the jermlaine don’t kill their victim and uses metal\nobjects from the victim to feed the rust monsters.\n\n17. Jermlaine Den. The jermlaine have tiny passageways\ncarved throughout this area, leading to their diminutive living\nalcoves and scattered treasure troves. Because of the size of\ntheir tunnels, only those as small as a jermlaine can traverse\nthe passageways.\n\nCreatures (EL varies): A combined total of 30 jermlaine live\nin the clan: 2 from area 3, 4 from area 4, 4 from area 11, and\n23 others. Of these, twelve are noncombatant children. The\nother eleven have 3 hit points each; see area 3 for complete\nstatistics.\n\nTreasure: In the event the PCs somehow manage to force\nthe jermlaine to hand over their treasure, it consists of 14 gp,\n103 sp, seven gems valued at 10 gp each, two potions of cure\nlight wounds, and a scroll of levitate. The jermlaine are illiter-\nate and unaware of the scroll’s value: After the chieftain’s chil-\ndren fingerpainted crude images on the back of it in mud, he\nhung it in his den. The jermlaine band also has the equivalent\nof 150 feet of rope cut into various lengths, all woven from\nhumanoid hair.\n\nExiting the Gauntlet\nThe PCs should have no trouble exiting the Gauntlet, as they\nwill have already encountered all of the traps on their way in,\nand the jermlaine won’t be looking for them anymore. PCs who\nwere “incinerated” by the stair trap at area 12 are found naked,\nbound, and probably fast asleep (under the effects of pseudo-\ndragon venom) in area 2 when the PCs return. All of their gear\nis gone: Metallic items have been taken to Snooky’s lair in area\n9; everything else has been claimed by the jermlaine.\n\nAny of the magic weapons taken from area 13 (the two\nsiangham, the spiked gauntlet, and the falchion) automatically\nteleport back to that room when taken outside the confines of\nthe Gauntlet. Any weapons taken from the treasure room in\narea 15 remain with the PCs as they exit the Gauntlet.\n\nAs “Gorgoldand’s Gauntlet” is primarily a puzzle-based\nadventure, players who prefer “more action, less thinking”\nmight feel short-changed. If your players are of that bent, the\nfollowing scenario can be inserted at the very end of the\nadventure when the PCs climb back up to the clifftop after\nexiting the Gauntlet. Remember that by the time the PCs have\nfinished the Gauntlet, they should be 2nd level. (They won’t\ngain a level until they have rested, however.) PCs weakened by\ntheir ordeal in the dungeon will find this encounter challeng-\ning. As the DM, you must take a careful measure of the party\nbefore throwing this encounter their way.\n\nCreatures (EL 4): The PCs aren’t the only ones with a copy\nof the map leading to the Gauntlet. Several other adventuring\nbands have already experienced the Gauntlet for themselves\nand moved on in either triumph or disappointment. One par-\nticular band, Rotvil’s Rogues, entered the Gauntlet and were\nquickly rebuffed. Not willing to be driven away from possible\ntreasure by a bunch of stinking jermlaine, but also not partic-\nularly eager to return to the Gauntlet’s interior, the Rogues\nhave been camping out in the area, licking their wounds and\nkeeping an eye out for other adventuring bands. When the PCs\napproached and entered the cavern network, Rotvil and his\n\ngang saw their chance for some quick riches: All they had to\ndo was hang around until the PCs returned from the Gauntlet\nand take their accumulated loot from them.\n\nBy the time the second PC climbs up to the top of the cliff,\nshe finds a party of four humanoids racing on foot toward the\ncliff from 300 feet away, hollering like banshees. (The Rogues\nhad intended on getting here earlier and setting up an ambush,\nbut as usual, poor planning and a sleepy sentry got in the way\nof their ambitions.) Rotvil, the leader, is a half-orc barbarian;\ndespite their name, only one gang member is a rogue. The oth-\ners are a dwarven ranger and a human monk. All four have\nweapons drawn as they race toward the PCs. Rotvil wields a\ngreatsword, the monk has a javelin, and the other two wield\nloaded crossbows. Their plan was simple: take the first PC\nhostage if possible, disarm him, and repeat the process with\neach PC as he reached the top of the cliff. Unfortunately for\nthem, their tardiness means the PCs have a better chance of\nholding on to their well-earned treasure.\n\nTactics: Rotvil rages and races headlong into melee combat.\nMontego the monk hurls his javelin and then closes for hand-\nto-hand combat as well. The other two hold their distance and\nuse their crossbows, switching to melee weapons only when\nthey run out of bolts or the PCs close in on them.\nk Rotvil, Male Half-orc Bbn2: CR 2; Medium-Size Humanoid\n\n(6 ft. tall); HD 2d12+2; hp 20; Init +1 (Dex); Spd 40 ft.; AC 14 (+1\nDex, +3 armor); Atk +4 melee (2d6+2/crit 19-20, greatsword)\nor +4 melee (1d4+2/crit 19-20, dagger); SA rage 1/day; SQ\nhalf-orc, uncanny dodge (Dex bonus to AC); AL NE; SV Fort\n+4; Ref +1; Will –1; Str 14, Dex 13, Con 12, Int 8, Wis 9, Cha 10.\n\nSkills: Climb +6, Jump +6, Listen +3, Wilderness Lore +2.\nFeat: Weapon Focus (greatsword).\n\nPossessions: Studded leather armor, greatsword, dagger,\nwaterskin, backpack.\nk Breagar, Male Dwarf Rgr1: CR 1; Medium-Size Humanoid\n\n(4 ft. 2 in. tall); HD 1d10+2; hp 12; Init +5 (+1 Dex, +4 Improved\nInitiative); Spd 20 ft.; AC 14 (+1 Dex, +3 armor); Atk +2 ranged\n(1d8/crit 19-20, light crossbow) or +3 melee (1d4/crit 19-20,\ndagger); SA favored enemy (goblinoids); SQ dwarf, track; AL\nLE; SV Fort +4, Ref +1, Will -1; Str 11, Dex 12, Con 15, Int 9, Wis\n9, Cha 8.\n\nSkills: Listen +2, Move Silently +3, Intuit Direction +2,\nWilderness Lore +2.

That’s a question that’s been deliber-\nately left for you to answer, as best fits your campaign. It’s\npossible that the gold dragon is off visiting the outer planes or\nengaged in a tricky bit of spell research; he might even have\nbeen captured by a powerful enemy. Rescuing the gold dragon\nmight be a task for the PCs once they reach higher levels and\nlearn of his existence.\n\nAt your discretion, Gorgoldand can keep a watchful eye over\nthe PCs’ actions through the scrying ability of their newly-\nacquired Hoardmaster sword. If the dragon deems them wor-\nthy, he might approach them in the future to hire them for a\nspecific task, or possibly even help the PCs get out of a hard\nspot. (Don’t make this a common occurrence, lest the players\ncome to expect their powerful gold dragon buddy to show up\nevery time they get into a jam.) Of course, Gorgoldand need\nnot present himself in dragon form, but merely as a human\nsage, wizard, or sorcerer. In any case, if the PCs gain\nHoardmaster, you have a possible link to future adventures.\nAny of the following ideas could be developed into a further\nadventure:\n\n• A Hoardmaster sword is stolen from another adventuring\nband who survived a previous excursion into the Gauntlet.\nThese NPCs learn of the PCs’ Hoardmaster, jump to the erro-\nneous conclusion that the PCs stole the sword from them, and\nmake appropriate plans for payback.\n\n• It turns out that Gorgoldand put a few extra abilities in his\nHoardmaster swords. After succumbing to a magic trap leav-\ning him petrified but still conscious, the dragon sends his will\nout to the nearest Hoardmaster (the one owned by the PCs,\nnaturally) and uses the sword to point the way to his location.\nThe PCs must follow the sword to Gorgoldand’s location, brav-\ning whatever dangers face them on the way.\n\n• A sorcerer holding Hoardmaster finds that, perhaps due\nto the legendary claim that dragon blood courses through a\nsorcerer’s veins, she can actually scry through Gorgoldand’s\neyes! This might be a good way for the PCs to learn of the\nsword’s link to the gold dragon that created it and could eas-\nily lead to adventures based on knowledge obtained through\nGorgoldand’s vision.\n\nJohnathan is the author of several DUNGEON Magazine modules,\nincluding the popular “Challenge of Champions” series.

Despite the risk of possible death and \ninfection, they forge ahead, knowing full well that only the secrets of that which lies at the center \nof this horrific outbreak will save them.  However, the solution to this mystery could very well be \nthe end of all they know, or the beginning of something they never before imagined. \n \nPreparation \nAll that is required to use this adventure is a copy of the Player's Handbook, the Dungeon Master's \nGuide, and the Monster Manual.  All NPC and monster statistics are provided with each encounter \nin an abbreviated form, or where appropriate, the proper page and resource is clearly referenced. \n \nText that appears in shaded boxes is considered player information, which you can (at your \ndiscretion) read aloud to, paraphrase, or hand out to when appropriate.  Unshaded boxes contain \nimportant information that you (as the Dungeon Master, or DM) should pay particular attention \nto and will often contain special instructions. \n \nLastly, after each NPC description one will find two new sections, labeled as NPC Initiation and \nNPC Continuation.  Both of these sections are optional, but could be of great use to most DM's.  \nThis information is provided with the forward-looking DM in mind, and it is not required for the \nsuccessful completion of the adventure. \n \nThe NPC Initiation section provides helpful suggestions for introducing that particular NPC to \nthe party, as well as possibly providing information for use in seamlessly blending the NPC into \nthe scenery of a DM's campaign. \n \nThe NPC Continuation section provides seeds that the DM can use, throughout the PC's \ninteraction with the NPC, to plant ideas for future adventures or encounters involving or relating \nto that particular NPC. \n \nAdventure Synopsis \nA horrible, crippling malady has befallen the homeland of the PC's, killing countless people with \ncold, unfeeling indifference.  The source of this sickness is ultimately traced to the sudden \nappearance of a strange blight-like plant growth in a near-by forest.  Seeking answers, the PC's \ntravel to this blighted glade and along the way encounter a crazed druid.  This druid, who has \nobviously been driven mad by the disease, babbles incoherently about “talking trees” and \n“whispering willows” within the infected forest.  He warns the characters with an ominous tone \nthat “enlightenment and death lie within” before attacking them in a madness-born rage. \n \nOnce the obstacle of the insane druid has been overcome and the PC's enter the glade, they \neventually learn that the source of the infection is actually a sentient, living plant form.  The \nplant, which is native from the Ethereal plane, was somehow seeded on the Prime Material.  \nNow, far away from its native realm of potential matter, it has discovered that it can feed off of \nthe dreams and mental energy of other sentient creatures.  The plant does not wish to harm \n\n\n\nanyone, but it struggles to survive, and the horrible disease is a ramification of its attempts to \ncommunicate and sustain itself. \n \nThe PC's, now faced with a thorny quandary, must decide whether or not to help this marooned \nplant by becoming its hosts, or destroying it.  Either way they will be able to save their homeland, \nbut one way offers a passage into a broader, more remarkable realm. \n \nInitial Adventure Hooks \nThe very existence of a disease that is quickly reaching plague-like proportions, not to mention \nthe suffering and deaths of many of their townsfolk, loved ones, family, or servants should be \nenough to propel the characters into this adventure.  However, for more callous PC's, seeking out \nand eliminating the cause of this disease might have the distasteful ring of “Good Samaritan” to \nit.  This, of course, might not speak to their primary motivators – their purses.  If this is the case, \ntry one (or even a clever combination of two) of the following three ways to get them moving in \nthe right direction. \n \n\n- One (or all) of the PC's have themselves become infected and everyone else seems too \nsick to help them.  They face two choices – either do something about their situation or \ndie a horrible, ghastly death. \n\n- The local church offers a substantial bounty (1,000-5,000 gp) for the cure of the disease, as \ntheir best efforts have succeeded in merely slowing the disease's inevitable march of \ndoom. \n\n- Perhaps the PC's are not infected at all, but they know that they have been exposed to the \ndisease.  Seeing the horrible, painful and wasting results of the disease should be a very \npowerful motivator for any character that even suspects that he might be infected. \n\n \nOnce the PC's have their incentive, they should begin looking for information.  Allow the \ncharacters to make a few checks (Gather Information or Bardic Knowledge work nicely) around \ntown where they could learn any of the following: \n \n\nSources of the Disease \nDC  Information \n10 There is no cure for the disease.  Everyone that has contracted it so far has \n\nperished. \n15 The disease causes a slow, painful death and towards the end, folks say they hear \n\nstrange voices. \n20 The disease seemed to begin on the edges of the wilds and gradually worked its \n\nway into the civilized areas. \n25 Everyone with the disease has visions of a nearby forest landmark – perhaps a \n\nwaterfall, a particular copse of trees, a well-known pond, or perhaps an ancient, \nknobby oak. \n\n30 One of the first folk seen with the disease was a ranger who lived in the forests to \nthe northeast; seems he came to town seeking healing. \n\n \nOnce the PC's have gathered their information, they should have a clear trail to follow.  It \nseems that some substantial clues to the disease (if not the source of the infection itself) lies in \nthe forest nearby. \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\nLeaves of Grass (EL 2) \nSince he passed his every waking hour tending his fledgling forest grove, the druid known as \nTolvis Fawndancer was one of the first individuals to be infected by the otherworldly plant.  \nNow, even despite the fact that he has been infected longer than any other victim of the plant, \nhe survives due to his close ties to nature and his hardy disposition.  Due to his exacting and \nrigorous training in the ways of nature, he knew the moment he came in contact with the \nplant that it was sentient.  Excited beyond measure, he tried many times, through his druidic \npowers, to contact the plant creatures, but failed time and time again.  Each time he came in \ncontact with the plant he became more infected and entwined with these creatures. \n \nAs a result, he is now almost mindless and utterly insane.  On one hand, he wishes to protect \nthis unique creature of nature, but on the other hand, he knows that it is somehow killing \nhim.  Seeking the solace of the only true balm that he has ever known, Tolvis strips down to \nmere rags and clothes himself in the trappings of nature – with mud, leaf, and twig as his \narmor, he seeks to rid himself of this horrible, mind racking agony. \n \nThe result of this is an exceedingly unstable, bizarre looking and dangerous individual, one, \nwhich the characters now come in contact with.  As the players begin the encounter with the \ncrazed druid, read the following aloud to the players: \n \nAs you travel along the forest path, you get the uneasy feeling that someone is watching you.  \nYour finely honed instincts warn you that you are not alone, and you notice that what looks \nlike a large holly bush is in fact keeping tabs on you.  Wide, crazed eyes stare out of a mask of \nprickly holly leaves, dirt, grass and sweat while the thing's dry, cracked lips seem to mouth \nthe same phrase over and over again.  You realize the word at the same time that you realize \nthat it is a half-naked, leaf-covered man that is silently speaking it – “Run”, the man-thing \nwhispers harshly, “Run”... \n \nThe crazed druid reacts initially as the PC's react - if they draw weapons and make ready to \nattack or defend, then the druid screams his warning (see the Adventure Synopsis, above) \nand attacks in turn.  If the PC's attempt to parlay, then the druid will remain calm enough to \nconvey some information to the PC's.  Initially, Tolvis will tell the characters to flee - thus his \nwarning to 'Run', above - but he will also try and tell the PC's of the wonder and danger that \nawaits them within the blighted grove.  His speech is full of double-speak and contradictions, \nbut if the characters remain patient, they will at least get a hint of what there is to come. \n \nTolvis will only talk to the PC's for about three rounds, before he becomes increasingly \nirritated and unstable.  The source of this increased irritation is actually the plant creature, \ncalling for him to gain the character's help, because they can sense that they are near, but the \npoor druid simply cannot understand them.  He becomes irate, and loses his grip on reality \nand attacks the PC's, screaming at them to “leave him be” and “quiet their voices” in his \nhead. \n \nThe characters are now faced with a tense situation, do they slay this poor, diseased and \ncrazed man or attempt to somehow detain and possibly help him?  Tolvis can be helped, but \nonly if he is neutralized as a threat - as long as he is conscious he will continue to attack the \nPC's to the fullest extent that his abilities will allow. \n \nAd Hoc XP Adjustment: \nDue to the difficulty involved in this encounter, award PC's that find a non-violent solution \nto this quandary an extra +50% experience points; for PC's that use a bit of force, but still \ncome up with a non-lethal solution, award an extra +25% experience points. \n\n\n\n \nThe Mad Druid \nTolvis Fawndancer; Male elf Druid 4; CR 4; Medium-size humanoid; HD 4d8; hp 22; Init +1; \nSpd 20ft.; AC 14 [+1 Dex, +3 Hide]; Atk +2 (1d6 halfspear); SV Fort +4, Ref +2, Will +6; Str  8, \nDex 12, Con 10, Int 11, Wis 14, Cha 9. \nSkills and Feats: Animal Empathy +6, Concentration +4, Heal +6, Intuit Direction +3, Swim \n+3, Wilderness Lore +10; Endurance, Track. \nPossessions: Hide armor, Halfspear, waterskin, Totem charms, journal (recent entries detail \nmental illness). \nSpells: Due to his mental illness, Tolvis has no spells memorized at this time. \nTolvis Fawndancer has only ever known the forest as his home, his shelter and his place of \nrespite and peace.  Since the day of his birth, he has never set foot outside the shadows of the \nboughs that he lovingly calls home.  A member of a small, almost reclusive clan of forest \nelves, Tolvis grew up learning the intricate ways of his forest dwelling, and the call of the \ndruid came readily and easily to him.  In fact, it seemed to come almost natural for him, \nparticularly the healing, growing, and tending of plants, for which he seemed to have a \nspecial knack. \n \nWhile Tolvis and his family knew of the outside world and heard of all of its wonders from \npassers-by and visitors, they simply had no desire to leave their home.  They all, like Tolvis, \nwere content to marvel at the sheer breath-taking beauty that nature had surrounded them \nwith rather than travel hither and yon. \n \nNPC Initiation: \nIntroducing Tolvis into play is quite simple, as he is the primary focus of interaction in the \nprevious encounter entitled  “Leaves of Grass” (see the information provided above). \n \nNPC Continuation: \nHow Tolvis continues to function within a campaign depends greatly on the outcome of the \naforementioned encounter.  If he PC’s kill the poor, mad, druid then there can be no future \ndealings with him. \n \nSimilarly, if they attack, but do not kill the druid he will remember it and it is a sure bet that \nif he ever comes to his senses that the characters have made an enemy for life.  If this in \nindeed the case, then it should be very easy for a cunning DM to work Tolvis into an existing \ncampaign as a now half-crazed druid bent for revenge against the characters. \n \nHowever, if the PC’s help and heal the druid, then he could become a valuable ally in the \nfuture.  Tolvis, if he survives this encounter, is destined to become a great and powerful \ndruid in this area, and he will owe his life and his sanity to the character’s heroic and noble \nactions.  He could become a dependable contact for the characters and would even go so far \nas providing a “home away from home” for them in his grove.  The characters could use the \ndruid not only as a source of information, but also as a safe haven whenever they are in the \narea. \n \nDismissing a contact with this much potential for future campaign development would be a \nnear crime for any DM.  The DM could use Tolvis as the springboard for countless \nadventures or adventure seeds; the druid will know that the characters are not only able, but \nalso of a similar mind set as he, so a bond of implicit trust could be formed amongst them.  \nTolvis and his people, in their desire to remain within the forest, could greatly benefit from \nhaving a group “on the outside” to aid them in their affairs, and in return, Tolvis can provide \nthe PC’s with free healing, nature-based magics, spells, items and tools, as well as teaching \n\n\n\nthem a “secret sign” known only to druids and their ilk.  The characters could then make use \nof these items and this knowledge during their future encounters. \n \nThe Blighted Grove (EL 4) \nWithin the interior of the blighted grove are the mysterious plants that are the root of this \nhorrible disease.  Native to the Ethereal plane, the Tween Thorns are normally a very \ninnocuous plant that grow sparsely throughout that plane.  Normally subsisting on the \nendless waves of proto matter, Tween Thorns provide a mainstay in the Ethereal ecology, or \nwhat passes for such; how they came to be on the Material Plane is anyone's guess. \n \nThese plants have fared only marginally better here than in their native home, but it is their \naffects on those that come in contact with them that has changed things so drastically.  Tween \nThorns are marginally sentient and on their native plane, which is ever in flux, they have to \nadapt quickly to survive.  They have used this ability to their advantage here in the PC's \nhomeland.  They have learned to feed off of the mental energies and dreams of sentient \ncreatures, as these things are the closest to their native fare.  However, they know that they \ncannot survive indefinitely in this manner and have been attempting to contact all with \nwhich they come in contact. \n \nIt is this combination that has caused the wasting disease that has spread from this tiny grove \ninto the PC's homeland.  Passing from infected individual to individual in the form of a \nmental thorn, it disturbs the thoughts and robs the dreams.  Thus, the body slowly begins to \nwaste away due to lack of rest and having its will to live sapped from it.  The Tween Thorns \ndo not know this, of course, so they continue to contact every new person who receives a \nmental thorn, thus continuing the vicious cycle.  Only through role-play can the characters \nmake the Tween Thorns understand what they are doing and reach a viable solution. \n \nThe solution is a simple one, but requires an act that most parties will not be willing to \nperform – the group must willingly become the hosts for the plant for a period of time.  In \norder for them to survive for any length of time on the Material Plane, the Tween Thorns \nneed a constant source of potential matter – that is, matter that has not formed into an actual \nsomething yet – the only place this is found outside of the Ethereal is within the dreams and \nunrealized thoughts of sentient beings.  However, in the case of the Tween Thorns’ other \n“victims”, they were neither aware nor willing of the plant’s need.  If the PC’s can learn that \nthis is what the plants need to survive and willingly give it as a group, then they can not only \nsustain the plants, but also evade any major ill effects. \n \nThe reason for the ill effects experienced by those infected by the disease can be likened to the \nway a drowning individual acts – when they are alone, frightened and fearing for their life \n(much like the Tween Thorns) they can very easily drown their savior in their near-mindless \nstruggle for survival.  However, if that same drowning individual is given a rope, then the \nfear subsides to the point where they can be saved.  The characters’ offer of their dreams and \nunconscious thoughts is the life-saving rope that the “drowning” Tween Thorns are so \ndesperately in need of.  It is only through patient role-playing and communication that the \nPC’s can find this out, however, and in order to do this they must first touch (or be touched \nby) one of the plant’s mental thorns. \n \nUpon entering the blighted grove, the characters will begin to notice the scattered presence of \na scraggly and pathetic looking weed all around.  Closer examination reveals that this plant \nis, despite its appearance, not dead, but in fact is lifeless looking by nature.  Tween Thorns \nlook more like a dead, thorn-ridden vine than anything else and are always (even on the \nEthereal) dull brown in coloration.  Anyone getting within five feet of the plant is subject to \n\n\n\nthe Tween Thorn’s “attack”, even if it could be called as such.  This attack comes in the form \nof the plant firing one of its countless thorns at the PC, and is actually the plant’s feeble \nattempt to communicate.  The Tween Thorn begins making attacks using its Mental Thorn \nability. For every 5’ a character progresses towards the center of the grove (up to 100’) the \nTween Thorn makes 2 attacks per round that can be divided amongst all characters present \n(so at 30’ in, the characters face 12 attacks per round).  However, once the characters have \ngone very far into the grove, they will soon find themselves dodging out of the range of one \npart of the plant and directly into the range of another of the plant’s thorn-bearing branches. \n \nIf the thorns at any time, strike the characters, proceed to the Voices in My Head section \nbelow for details.  However, there is a very likely chance that many highly cautious or skilled \nPC’s (or even an entire party) might not ever enter the grove or be struck by the thorns.  If \nyou encounter such a situation, see the section entitled Last Ditch Effort, below. \n \nTween Thorns CR 4 (4 HD Huge); 32 hp; AC 15; see Appendix. \n \nVoices in My Head \nOnce the PC’s have been struck, they immediately begin hearing the plant’s mental voice, \nwailing in despair, hunger, and fear.  Focusing the mind and attempting to tune out the \nchaotic din is far too great a task for a single character to try, but for every character that adds \nhis effort into the task, it becomes increasingly easier.  Have each player make a Will save \n(DC 15). Since the Tween Thorns can telepathically communicate with multiple minds at the \nsame time, characters are able to boost each other’s save. They gain a +2 bonus for every \ninfected character within 30’. The chaotic onslaught will continue either until someone makes \nthe save (and therefore is able to communicate clearly with the plant) or until 5 rounds are \nover. At that point, the plant gives up unless the characters leave and enter the grove  again. \nPsionic characters, despite their specific training in this area, simply cannot understand the \nalien thought process of this plant without the help of their fellows, however, completing this \ntask is considerably easier with a psionic character in the group’s midst. \n \nOnce the party has “broken through” the chaotic din that the plants are projecting, they can \nbetter understand the Tween Thorns, although it is still obvious that their way of thinking is \nutterly alien and foreign to the PC’s.  Initially, they always refer to themselves as “we” and \ndo not understand the concept of individuality.  No matter what the PC’s say to them, they \nwill always recognize the group as a single entity.  If one of the group somehow disconnects \nfrom the others, the Tween Thorns will morn the loss of their “lost branch”.  Also, the speech \nof the plant is halting and oddly timed – they often put the verbs of their statements first and \njumble the rest of the sentence together almost as an afterthought.  For example, if the Tween \nThorns are trying to tell the party that they are hungry, they might convey the following: \n“Eat-must……or die else we might.”  Therefore, allow the characters a bit of time to acclimate \nthemselves before throwing them into the details of what must be done to save the ethereal \nplant. \n \n \nDecisions, decisions… \nEventually, after the characters have learned a bit about the Tween Thorns and the fact that \nthey are truly harmless and merely lost, they will have to decide exactly how to deal with \nthem.  They really have two choices, one is to destroy them, which any good-aligned party \nshould be loathe to do after learning about these albeit alien-seeming, but basically harmless \nplants.  Or they can elect to help them. \n \nThe first choice is easily completed, as the Tween Thorns have no way of defending \n\n\n\nthemselves here on the Material Plane.  A simple flaming torch is all that is needed to \nexterminate the plants.  However, since the characters must get close to the thorns to kill \nthem (as they are impervious to magical fire), they will be forced to listen to the anguished, \nsoul-wrenching cries of the murdered Tween Thorns in their heads.  Make certain, as DM, \nthat these are sounds that will haunt them to the end of their days.  (For ideas on how to use \nthis event for additional campaign or adventure ideas, please see the Concluding the \nAdventure section below). \n \nAd Hoc Adventure Adjustment: At the DM’s discretion, you may elect to have the act of \ndestroying the Tween Thorns to be not such a traumatic and horrific act.  Despite the \ncontinued effort of the Tween Thorns (see Last Ditch Effort, below), some parties might not \never recognize the sentience of the plant.  Therefore, having to endure the massive negative \nside effects for destroying what they see as “only a disease causing weed” could be \nconsidered a bit excessive. \n \nIf this is the case, merely convey to the PC’s that as they destroy the plant, they notice that it \ndoes not merely crinkle up, but rather thrashes about as if alive.  They will experience intense \nsensations of loss, grief, pain, and despair as the plant expires and there should be little doubt \nthat they have just wrongly destroyed what was more than a mere plant.  Leave each \ncharacter to deal with this guilt in their own way, but most good characters, especially \npaladins and clerics, might want to seek atonement for their actions.  If this alternate method \nis used for completing the encounter, please proceed to Concluding the Adventure section \nbelow and see the note regarding the Ad Hoc Adventure Adjustment. \n \nLast Ditch Effort \nHowever, some astute characters might devise a way to exterminate the Tween Thorns from \nafar, such as with the use of flaming arrows, oil grenades, and the like.  This method, of \ncourse, precludes the characters being struck with the thorns, and causes a bit of problem \nwith the remainder of the adventure.  If this is the case, the Tween Thorns will know it, and \nuse nearly all of their remaining life force to try and convey to the characters that they are in \nfact, friendly. \n \nThe Tween Thorns somehow sense that this force that has arrayed itself against them is both \nits last chance and its possible doom.  So, it does the only thing that it knows to do normally \nto frighten away predators on the Ethereal – it uses its projection power.  Normally, this \npower is rarely used as it saps an enormous amount of the plant-creature’s life force, even in \nits native environs of potential matter.  It saps the plant even more here, but it knows that if it \ndoes not try now, it very well will perish. \n \nThe Tween Thorns’ projection power allows it to manifest potential energy into kinetic \nenergy, in a myriad of forms.  Normally, however, the Tween Thorns transfer this potential \nenergy into the form that it was intended to take, basically, they can make dreams into \nreality.  This only happens for a brief period of time, but it is quite a startling display, to say \nthe least.  It is normally quite sufficient to frighten off any predators, and in this case, is just \nenough to give the character’s pause before they seal the plant’s doom.  If this occurs, read \nthe following: \n \n\n\n\nBefore your eyes you see the dreams your townsfolk, family, friends, servants, or even those \nfrom your own mind (for those that are infected) materialize and evaporate at a frightening \npace.  It is like watching a dream unfold, but with your eyes open  sights, sounds, fragrances, \nscenes, and people appear before them.  As you watch, mouths agape, you begin to see a \nsimilar theme that runs throughout the conjoined dreams – “Plants need help.  Partake of \nThorns.  Mean no harm.  Help Us.” \n \nAfter seeing this startling display, only the most thickheaded of characters will still seek to \ndestroy the plants without question.  If the PC’s decide to destroy the plants despite all of \nthis, there is little that one can do.  However, if they decide to take a closer look and enter the \ngrove, proceed with the adventure by returning to the section entitled The Blighted Grove, \nabove. \n \nA Meeting of the Minds \nIf the characters decide to take the road dictated by kindness and higher morals, then things \nare considerably different for them.  If they at any point ask the Tween Thorns what they can \ndo to help (or something similar), the plants will respond that they can become its host for a \nperiod of time until a way to get them home can be found.  In order to become a host for the \nTween Thorns, the characters must partake of its fruit, which essentially becomes the \nembodiment of the entire plant creature for a period of time.  A part of the fruit must be eaten \nby each of the PC’s that intend to be hosts, but there must be at least three PC’s in order for it \nto work.  Once the fruit has been created, there is no going back for the Tween Thorns, and if \nat least three of the characters partake of the fruit, the plant dies horribly at their hands (see \nabove for effects). \n \nOnce the characters consume the fruit, each one experiences a highly unusual sensation of \nanother unique presence entering their minds.  It is not in the least bit painful, but it is \nincreasingly odd and unusual, to say the least.  Once the Tween Thorns are “settled” in the \nminds of the characters, the chaotic din dies down immediately.  Further, all of those folks \nwho had contracted the “disease” instantly experience a sense of relief and a return of mental \nstability.  They are, in essence, “cured”, as the Tween Thorns are no longer attempting to \ncontact them.  Many of them (including Tolvis) will be perfectly fine after a long, long period \nof restful, rejuvenating sleep, complete with vivid, spectacular dreams. \n \nConcluding the Adventure \nNo matter which road the PC’s took to cure the dreaded disease that was consuming their \nhomeland, the disease can be vanquished with little or no harm to the PC’s themselves (or \nrather, physical harm, that is).  They will still return to their homeland as heroes, having \ndestroyed the disabling disease; however it is the ramifications of exactly how they \naccomplished their deed that they must continue to deal with. \n \nIf the PC’s chose to destroy the Tween Thorns, they will be continually haunted by the \nmental screams and voices of the murdered plants.  Sleep will bring them no respite either, \nfor their dreams will be filled with images and voices so horrific that they can get little to no \nsleep.  They will slowly begin wasting away almost as if they were the only ones NOT cured \nby the disease.  It is not a disease, of course, but rather the trapped spirit of the Tween Thorn \nthat inhabits them and they will eventually die if they do not take steps to cleanse \nthemselves. \n  \nThis dire situation can lead to any number of spin-off adventures, or even into an entire \ncampaign wherein the PC’s are searching for a cure to this near “possession” within \nthemselves.  Conventional magic can do little for them, as they are not technically sick, nor \n\n\n\nare they “possessed” by any foul denizen from beyond.  Only through a journey of self-\ncleansing and purification can they eventually expunge themselves of this horrible crime and \nfree the trapped spirit of the Tween Thorns. \n \nHowever, if the DM elected to use the Ad Hoc Adventure Adjustment as shown above, then \nthe characters still return as heroes, but they still must deal with their guilt in their own way.  \nCharacters that seek atonement might have to undertake a holy pilgrimage for their church, \nor undergo a purification ritual that can only be preformed in a remote area of their \nhomeland.  Characters that do not seek penance for their rash act might be plagued by \nreoccurring dreams or possibly become introverted and sullen. \n \nIf the party elected to become hosts of the Tween Thorns, the disease is cured and they have a \nnew goal ahead of them – find someway to return the plant-creature to its home.  While \nbeing a host of the Tween Thorns has its downsides (the host characters are continually tired \nand restless, and do not dream for the duration of the time they are hosts), it also has an \nunexpected and unforeseen upside.  The host characters can now communicate telepathically \nthrough the link that the Tween Thorn has between them.  This telepathic bond gradually \nmakes itself known within a few days of eating the fruit and can lead to quite a number of \ninteresting role-playing situations in itself! \n \n Just as with destroying the Tween Thorns, saving them opens up a whole new realm of \npossibilities for continued adventures and campaign potential.  The party could find \nthemselves searching through ancient ruins for clues on the origin of this plant-creature, or \ncontracting out to a wizened sage for information on its extra planar home.  Their search \ncould lead even to the planes beyond the Prime Material, as they strive to return their charge \nto its long lost home. \n \nNevertheless, the characters will be hailed as heroes in their homeland for saving countless \nlives and vanquishing an invisible and malevolent enemy.  They could have possibly gained \na powerful ally in the form of a growing and knowledgeable forest druid.  They will be \nknown as the saviors of countless lives and will find themselves on the short list of many \npowerful men and movements that need such able-bodied doers of good.  Perhaps a local \nchurch is in need of such stalwart adventurers to rescue a group of humble monks that are \ntrapped and besieged in a mountain tower by dark, demonic creatures?  Perhaps a local lord \nhas learned of a foul, barbarian presence in his sparsely inhabited kingdoms to the north?  \nThere is no end to the adventures that await them just beyond the next bend… \n \n\n\n\nAppendix I: \nThe following appendix contains information used in this adventure and comprises a new \ncreature, the Tween Thorns, as well as a new template to accompany those characters that \nmight become “hosts” of that creature.  All of the information contained within the stat \nblocks should be considered open content, but all other information pertaining to these \nentries are closed content and may not be used without express written permission of the \nauthors, as detailed in the Open Gaming License. \n \nNew Monster: Tween Thorns \nType:  Large Plant \nHit Dice: 1HD \nInitiative:  +4 \nSpeed: 5ft \nAC: 16 (-1 size, +7 natural armor) \nAttacks: Mental Thorns +4 \nDamage:  - \nFace/Reach: 10ft’x10ft’/20ft’ (per HD) \nSpecial Attacks: Mental Thorns (Su), \nMental Disease (Su) \nSpecial Qualities: None \nSaves:   Fort +1, Ref +4, Will -3 \nAbilities: Str 10, Dex 17, Con 10, Int 7, \nWis 4, Cha 2 \nSkills:  None \nFeats: None \nClimate/Terrain: Ethereal Plane (or \nAny Forest or Swamp when on \nMaterial Plane) \nOrganization: None \nChallenge Rating: 2 \nTreasure: None \nAlignment: Neutral \nAdvancement: 3HD Huge to 10 HD Gigantic \n \nDescription: \nLooking more like a scraggly, dead vine than anything else, Tween Thorns are dull gray in \ncoloration and wholly unremarkable.  Only the proliferation of its many and often large \nthorns and eternally lifeless-looking leaves set it out from other plants, and even then, most \nfolks would want to avoid it (rather than investigate further) as a result of its mere \nappearance. \n \nCombat: \nMental Thorns (Su) – Ranged touch attack (+4) that causes no damage, but character must \nmake Will save (DC 15) in order to understand chaotic thought flow.  \n \nTween Disease (Su) – Those within 1 mile of Tween Thorns or other infect persons must \nmake a Will save (DC 20) every 24 hours or else be infected by the plant’s pollen. Effects are \nslow to occur, but within one week, severe mental illnesses (especially paranoia and \nhallucinations) begin to occur. Unless the Tween Thorn is either destroyed or persuaded to \nstop the mental drain, those infected die within 2 weeks. \n \n \n\n\n\nHabitat/Society: \nVery little is known about the society of the Tween Thorns, other than the fact that they are \nsentient.  However, it is theorized that massive congregations of these plants can be found on \nthe Ethereal plane, buy exactly what the purpose of these gatherings could be.  Of course \nfunctions such as mating and communication are assumed, but no such reasons have yet \nbeen proved.  It is also not known if Tween Thorns can communicate with others of their \nkind, but this too, is assumed to be the case. \n \nEcology: \nTween Thorns are a natural part of the Ethereal ecology, or whatever passes for such.  They \nsubsist on a diet of potential energy that is gleaned from proto-matter, which is thought to \ncomprise the bulk of that plane.  In turn, these sentient plants provide a stable and relatively \neasy to harvest food base for many of the larger and more powerful creatures and inhabitants \nof that plane.  Further, nothing is known about the reproductive habits or cycles of these \nelusive creatures. \n \nNew Template: Tween Thorn Hosts \nTween Thorns are sentient plants normally encountered solely on the Ethereal Plane, but can \nbe rarely found on the Material Plane as well.  Tween Thorn’s normal method of \ncommunication is via a connection that it creates with an individual that is struck or jabbed \nby one of its numerous thorns.  However, it is only when characters willingly attempt to \nbecome hosts for the plant that some alterations occur within their minds and bodies.  \nFurther, there are very specific qualifications that must be met before this alteration is \nconsidered even moderately beneficial, as detailed below. \n \nCreating Tween Thorn Host characters: \nFirst, only characters that agree to willingly undergo the process of hosting the sentience of \nthe Tween Thorns will be allowed the opportunity to consume the plant’s fruit.  This fruit is \nessentially the life force and the sentience of the plant itself, and it by no means will produce \nit for no reason or for just anyone that happens along.  Only in the darkest hour and if it \nmeans the difference between life and death for the plant; even then if the Tween Thorns do \nnot feel that the individuals can be trusted, it will not produce the fruit. \n \nHowever, once the fruit has been formed, at least three willing characters must partake of it \nand eat of it their entire portion.  Once these conditions have been met, the host characters \nwill immediately the slightly negative side effects, but will come to realize the beneficial ones \nwithin a few days. \n  \nType: Same as base creature \nHit Dice: Same as base creature \nInitiative: Same as base creature \nSpeed: Same as base creature \nAC: Same as base creature \nAttacks: Same as base creature \nDamage: Same as base creature \nFace/Reach: Same as base creature \nSpecial Attacks: None \nSpecial Qualities: Characters that become hosts for Tween Thorns will immediately notice a \ndistinct lack of mental and physical energy.  While this is not so great as to affect everyday \nlife (or adventuring), it does create the opportunity for the player to role-play an irritable, \ngrumpy and somewhat surly character.  Also, characters will not sleep as well, and \nthroughout the duration of the time that they are hosts, they will not dream at all. \n\n\n\n \nHowever, within a few days of becoming hosts, the characters (minimum of three) will begin \nto notice that they have a means of telepathy (as per the spell) amongst them.  Characters can \nuse this ability as will, for as long as they are host of the Tween Thorns. \n \nSaves: Same as base creature \nAbilities: Same as base creature \nSkills: Same as base creature \nFeats: Same as base creature \nClimate/Terrain: Same as base creature \nOrganization: Same as base creature \nChallenge Rating: Same as base creature \nTreasure: Same as base creature \nAlignment: Same as base creature \nAdvancement Range: Same as base creature \n \nTween Thorn Host Characters: Due to the rarity of the Tween Thorns on the Material Plane, \nDM’s should have little difficulty in balancing these sorts of characters within game play and \ntheir campaigns.  Further, most characters would probably not want to remain hosts for an \nindefinite period of time, as the Tween Thorns prefer living in their natural environment to \nwithin a host, and will not hesitate to tell the characters as much.  DM’s should feel free to \nextrapolate any penalties that they see fit for characters that attempt to abuse this template.  \nAfter all, the Tween Thorns are within the characters heads, and should be able to cause \nconsiderable pain, if so provoked.  Further, as this template does not confer any class-specific \nabilities, it should remain open, available, and attractive to all player classes and races. \n \n\n\n\n1 \n\n1 \n\n \n\n \n\nby Nathanael Christen \n \n\nFor many years the Bloodfang orc tribe was a \nscourge of civilization, raiding settled areas and \nstealing everything of value. Through many such \nraids, the tribe amassed quite a pile of treasure. \n\n No creature was more aware of this fact \nthan Korangar, the shaman who served the \nBloodfang tribe. Although Korangar disliked the \nblood and terror of raiding, he had a well \ndeveloped appreciation for the treasures that such \nactivity could garner. Unbeknownst to his kin, the \nshaman sought to acquire a hoard of treasure in \norder to secure the services of demons. Every time \nthe tribe conducted a raid, Korangar spirited away \na bit of the booty for himself. After many months \nof this thievery, his own secret hoard grew to a \nconsiderable sum. \n\n Now, Korangar was no fool. Knowing that \nit would be too dangerous to hide the stolen goods \ninside the tribe's lair, he instead converted a series \nof caves nearby to store his cache. In this \nendeavor he called upon the tribe's adept and a \nband of warriors for assistance, telling them that \nthe place would serve as a secret temple and \npromising them gold for their silence. Soon they \nhad constructed a well-fortified trove. Then, in \ntrue orc fashion, Korangar repaid them by \nmurdering them. \n\n In the end, however, Korangar was never \nable to enjoy his ill-begotten gains. The shaman \nmet his end when a band of adventurers raided the \ntribe's lair. Had it not been for the action of the \ntribe's adept, Nurott, the hoard might have been \nlost forever. This half-orc, hoping that he might \nlive to see the shaman's demise, gouged an \ninscription of the route to the cache into his \ncrystal prism before the shaman betrayed him. \nAfter their raid on the orcs' lair the prism was \nclaimed by the adventurers, who failed to \nrecognize its secret and hocked it as a semi-\nprecious bauble in the nearest marketplace. Since \nthen it has changed hands numerous times, finally \n\nending up in the possession of another band of \nadventurers. \n\nNurott's Prism \nThe map to Korangar's hoard is etched into the \n\nside of an ordinary crystal prism, the one the adept \nused in casting the spell read magic. A DC 10 \nSpot check is needed to notice the strange \nmarkings on the item. Holding it up to a light \nsource reveals what seems to be a cluster of three \nsmall hills, with a stream passing between them; at \nthe base of one hill is marked an \"x.\" An \ninscription on one side of the prism depicting the \nsetting sun denotes west. \n\nThe Journey  \nKorangar's Hoard can be placed in any \n\nconvenient location with the campaign setting, \nalthough it should be somewhat removed from \ncivilization. (The town square wouldn't work so \nwell, but a stretch of open land just beyond the \nsurrounding farms would.) The journey can be as \neventful as the DM desires, consisting of \nnumerous encounters or none at all. Perhaps the \nbest way to find the hoard is to identify the river \ndepicted on the prism and then to follow it until \nreaching the three hills; this can be achieved with \na DC 18 Knowledge: geography check. PC's might \nalso ask about the formation of three hills, finding \nsome information about the landform (and maybe \na tale of the battle with the orcs) on a DC 18 \nGather Information check. \n\nThe Hidden Temple \nArriving at the westernmost of the three hills, \n\njust where the map indicated, the PC's find \nKorangar's hidden temple. \n\n1. Cave Entrance \nThis is a low tunnel that leads into the side of \n\nthe hill. Its ceiling is only five feet high, forcing \nmany adventurers to crouch down; it is of similar \nwidth, allowing only one character to pass at a \ntime. Twenty feet into the cavern it is completely \ndark. At this point the walls are natural earth. \nCharacters who succeed at a DC 15 Wilderness \n\n\n\n2 \n\n2 \n\nLore check recognize signs of habitation (bits of \nbone and fur); those with the Track feat can \nidentify tracks of an unknown nature. \n\n2. Howler Lair (EL 5) \nHere the cavern becomes wider and taller \n\n(about seven feet in height). On the west side of \nthe cavern an accumulation of fur marks the place \nwhere the howlers sleep. A natural alcove in the \nnorth wall contains a mass of chewed bones and \nbits of clothing, the remains of the howlers' meals.  \n\n Creatures: A pair of howlers lives here; \nthey attack any who enter. \n\n Howlers (2): hp 43, 37. \n\n Tactics: The howlers, if they hear the \nparty approaching, attempt to encircle and then \nattack. \n\n Development: Beneath the bone pile lies \na trapdoor, easily found by anyone who \ninvestigates the pile, amongst tatters of clothing \nand armor, rusted weapons and similar bits of \ndiscarded equipment. An old, rusted lock secures \nthe trapdoor; it requires a DC 22 Open Locks \ncheck to open, or a DC 18 Strength check to \nbreak. Otherwise it has Hardness 5 and 15 hit \npoints. \n\n3. The Temple \nThe trapdoor opens onto a small antechamber; \n\na ladder leads down to the floor twelve feet below. \nAn archway leads into the main area of the \ntemple, a broad rectangular chamber of neatly \nworked stone with a ceiling that arches twenty feet \nabove. A series of ten pillars support the ceiling, \neach with a humanoid skeleton changed to it. The \nwalls are swathed in musty, stained tapestries that \ndepict glorious orc victories and dark rituals \nhonoring Gruumsh. At the north end of the \nchamber a stone altar lies beneath a statue \ndepicting the orc deity. \n\n In the north wall, behind the altar, is a \nsecret door that can be discovered on a successful \nSearch check (DC 20). The mechanism for \nopening this door is contained in the altar, in the \nform of a small reservoir built into the blood \n\ntrough. It is magical in nature; if a sufficient \namount of blood is poured onto the altar, the door \nswings open. Characters examining the altar might \nnotice (DC 18 Spot check) a faint blackish residue \nin the vicinity of the depression, and could \nidentify it as blood with a DC 15 Heal check. \n\n4. Study (EL 5) \nA stout wooden door grants entrance to this \n\nroom; it is solidly locked, requiring a DC 30 Open \nLocks check to bypass. Failing this, a DC 23 \nStrength check can force open the door, or \nsufficient damage from slashing weapons \n(Hardness 5; 20 hp) can destroy it. \n\nOn the floor against the west wall lies a \nsummoning circle, a raised stone platform \ninscribed with numerous arcane runes and sigils. \nA large desk occupies the north wall of this room, \nupon which rest a pair of tomes, one open and one \nclosed. \n\n Trap: The library is protected by a glyph \nof warding spell; any creature who opens the door \nwithout first uttering the words \"Gruumsh be \npraised\" suffers 3d8+7 damage from a cause \nserious wounds spell. \n\n Creatures: The room's only inhabitant is \na wraith that attacks any characters who enter the \nchamber. \n\nWraith: hp 35. \n\nTactics: The wraith hides in the back \nright corner of the room, then attacks from behind \nonce a few characters have entered, attempting to \nblock the doorway. (Keep in mind that its Combat \nReflexes feat allows it three attacks of \nopportunity.) \n\n Treasure: The open book is the text used \nin the worship of Gruumsh. Written in Infernal, it \ndescribes the rites and rituals used to supplicate \nthe dark lord of orcs. Of these, the most important \nis a blood sacrifice performed on nights of the \nnew moon; this rite is depicted in vivid detail in \nthe tome. There is also a spellbook, including the \nfollowing spells: mage armor, obscuring mist, \nsummon monster I, unseen servant; Melf's acid \narrow, summon monster II, summon swarm; flame \narrow, sepia snake sigil, summon monster III; \n\n\n\n3 \n\n3 \n\nEvard's black tentacles, summon monster IV; \nsummon monster V, lesser planar binding. \n\n The shelves against the south wall hold a \ncomplete alchemist's laboratory set. There is also a \ncollection of chemicals and components suitable \nfor use in alchemy. Feel free to make up \nappropriately mystical-sounding ingredients, such \nas wolf's blood, hair of the dretch and hell hound \nspittle. \n\n5. Meditation Chambers (EL 5) \nThis area was once used by the acolytes who \n\nattended to Korangar. Each room is a bare ten-foot \nby ten-foot chamber.  \n\n Creatures: The rooms are now occupied \nby a ghast and two ghouls, the barely recognizable \nwarriors who had once served Korangar in life and \nnow do so in undeath. \n\n Ghast: hp 27. \n\n Ghouls: hp 15, 12. \n\n Tactics: The undead attack unceasingly, \nrushing the first character who enters the room. \n\n6. Secret Passage (EL 4) \nThrough the secret door lies a natural passage. \n\nDue to seepage this area has filled with slimy \nmud; the muck is three feet deep, slowing \nmovement to one quarter normal. The muck is \nthree feet deep in the middle, and about a foot and \nhalf on the sides. Due to the amount of moisture in \nthe chamber, treat the walls as slippery (DC 25 \nClimb check). \n\n Creatures: In the time since the temple \nwas used, a gray ooze has taken up residence in \nthis area. \n\n Gray Ooze: hp 27. \n\n Tactics: The ooze, having not had a meal \nin some time, fights unceasingly.  \n\n Development: Keep in mind the rules for \ndrowning in this area if any character is \nincapacitated. \n\n7. Treasure Chamber \nA secret stone door seals the entrance to this \n\nchamber (a DC 20 search check is needed to find \nit). Beside it stands a life-size statue of a massive \norc. This statue is the key to the secret door; if its \nleft eye is pried free, the door swings open. Inside \nis a natural stone chamber; it is unremarkable, but \nfor the two chests that rest against the north wall. \nThe chests are locked with good quality (DC 25) \npadlocks. \n\n            Treasure: The chests contain \nKorangar's accumulated treasures: 6000 sp, 1250 \ngp, four onyxes (400 gp each), a ring of protection \n+2, a greataxe +1, a potion of love, a scroll \ncontaining hold person and summon monster III, \nand a Heward's handy haversack. \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n4 \n\n4 \n\nAppendix \nFull monster statistics are provided here for \n\neasy reference. \n\n \n\nHowlers (2): CR 4; Large outsider \n(Chaotic, Evil); HD 6d8+12; hp43, 37; Init +7; \nSpd 60 ft.; AC 17; touch 17, flat-footed 14 [-1 \nsize, +3 Dex, +5 natural]; Atk +10 melee \n(2d8+5, bite), 1d4 quills +5 melee (1d4+2); \nSQ Quills, howl; Face/Reach 5 ft. by 10 ft./5 \nft.; AL CE; SV Fort +7, Ref +8, Will +7; Str \n21, Dex 17, Con 15, Int 6, Wis 14, Cha 8. \n\n Skills and Feats: Climb +10, Hide +8, \nListen +11, Move Silently +8, Search +1, Spot \n+4; Alertness, Improved Initiative. \n\n \n\nWraith: CR 5; Medium-size undead \n(Incorporeal); HD 5d12; hp 35; Init +7; Spd \n30 ft., fly 60 ft.; AC 15; touch 15, flat-footed \n15 [+3 Dex, +2 deflection]; Atk +5 melee \n(1d4, touch); SQ Constitution drain, create \nspawn, undead, incorporeal, +2 turn \nresistance, unnatural aura, daylight \npowerlessness; Face/Reach 5 ft. by 5 ft./5 ft.; \nAL LE; SV Fort +1, Ref +4, Will +6; Str --, \nDex 16, Con --, Int 14, Wis 14, Cha 15. \n\n Skills and Feats: Hide +11, Intimidate \n+10, Intuit Direction +6, Listen +12, Search \n+10, Sense Motive +8, Spot +12; Alertness, \nBlind-Fight, Combat Reflexes, Improved \nInitiative. \n\n \n\nGhouls (2): CR 1; Medium-Size Undead; \nHD 2d12; hp 15, 12; Init +2; Spd 30 ft.; AC \n14; touch 14, flat-footed 12 [+2 Dex, +2 \nnatural]; Atk +3 melee (1d6+1, bite) and 2 \nclaws +0 melee (1d3); SQ Paralysis, create \nspawn, undead, +2 turn resistance; Face/Reach \n5 ft. by 5 ft./5 ft.; AL CE; SV Fort +0, Ref +2, \n\nWill +5; Str 13, Dex 15, Con --, Int 13, Wis \n14, Cha 16. \n\n Skills and Feats: Climb +6, Escape \nArtist +7, Hide +7, Intuit Direction +3, Jump \n+6, Listen +7, Move Silently +7, Search +6, \nSpot +7; Multiattack, Weapon Finesse (bite). \n\n \n\nGhast: CR 3; Medium-Size Undead; HD \n4d12; hp 26; Init +2; Spd 30 ft.; AC 16; touch \n16, flat-footed 14 [+2 Dex, +4 natural]; Atk \n+4 melee (1d8+1, bite) and 2 claws +1 melee \n(1d4); SQ Stench, paralysis, create spawn, \nundead, +2 turn resistance; Face/Reach 5 ft. by \n5 ft./5 ft.; AL CE; SV Fort +1, Ref +3, Will \n+6; Str 13, Dex 15, Con --, Int 13, Wis 14, \nCha 16. \n\n Skills and Feats: Climb +6, Escape \nArtist +8, Hide +8, Intuit Direction +3, Jump \n+6, Listen +8, Move Silently +7, Search +6, \nSpot +8; Multiattack, Weapon Finesse (bite). \n\n \n\nGray Ooze: CR 4; Medium-Size Ooze; \nHD 3d10+10; hp 27; Init -5; Spd 10 ft.; AC 5; \ntouch 5, flat-footed 5 [-5 Dex]; Atk +3 melee \n(1d6+1, slam); SQ Improved grab, acid, \ncorrosion, constrict, blindsight, cold and fire \nimmunity, ooze, camoflauge; Face/Reach 5 ft. \nby 5 ft./5 ft.; AL N; SV Fort +1, Ref -4, Will -\n4; Str 12, Dex 1, Con 11, Int --, Wis 1, Cha 1. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\tCitizen Games\n\n", "Advanced Dungeons & Dragons\n\nDungeon Module  #L1\n\nThe Secret of Bone Hill\nby Leonard Lakofka\n\nProduct Number: 9045\nYear Published: 1981\n\nConverted from 1st Edition to 3rd Edition D&D\nby Stephen Jung, jung@mbcl.rutgers.edu\nCreated: 11/19/2000\nLast Updated: 4/21/2001\n\nChanges Since Last Edition:\n•\tSpelling mistakes fixed.\n•\tpage 7: Changed chaotic quarterstaff +1 to heavy mace +3—Construct Bane.\n•\tPage 10: Corrected DC of glyph of warding from 19 to 17.\n•\tPage 18:Potion of cure moderate wounds corrected to potion of cure serious wounds.\n•\tPage 21: Corrected name of see invisibilty spell in Tolvar’s list.\n•\tPage 23: Wraith spawn corrected from wights to wraiths.\n•\tSample Player Characters: skill points of Male Human Clr2 corrected from 15 to 20.\n\nSummary of Conversion:  All monsters, NPCs, and new magic items have been converted to conform to 3rd Edition rules. Most guards have been changed from fighters to warriors, except the Captain of the Guard and multiclass guards. Weapons for rogues and druids have been changed to  fit the class restrictions from the Player’s Handbook.  Armor classes and hit points are adjusted for the 3rd Edition ability modifiers. Spells preapred are increased to account for bonus spells. Some characters are given ability scores from the NPC statistics section of the DUNGEON MASTER’S Guide, pages 49–57. Characters of 4th level and above have their ability score addition.\n   The number of platinum pieces, silver pieces, and copper pieces have been halved to account for the doubling of value from 1st Edition to 3rd Edition. The ep (electrum piece is worth 1/2 gp.\nOther Changes:\n•\tRandom Wilderness Encounter Table (p. 2–3/original p. 2a): The axe beak doesn’t exist in 3rd Edition, so I replaced it with the black bear. Carnivorous apes aren’t found in temperate climates, so I replaced it with the boar. Other animals are renamed to their 3rd Edition counterparts. Any temperate forest or hills creature may be substituted. \n •\tFaldelac’s staff of striking (p. 7/p. 4a): The staff of striking or the spell striking  does not exist in 3rd Edition, so I replaced it with a heavy mace +3—Construct Bane.\n•\tWolves (p. 18/p. 7a): I changed the dire wolves to normal wolves becuase dire wolves would be more powerful than their worg leaders.\n•\tWraith (p. 23/p. 8b): The wraith might be too tough for the normal party level.\n•\tWorkshop: (p. 31–32/p. 10b): Mild poisons were changed to arsenic and toxic poison to potions of poison.\n•\tGrellus/Fairwind (p. 50/p. 17a): I changed him from a 7th level fighter to a 1st level aristocrat/6th level fighter. I changed her from a 3rd level cleric to a 1st level aristocrat/2nd level cleric.\n•\tPelo (p. 65–66/p. 21): I changed him from a 2nd level fighter to a 1st level expert/1st level warrior.\n•\tPerk (p. 69/p. 22): I changed him from a 2nd level fighter to a 1st level expert/1st level warrior.\n•\tGellcuff: (p. 74–75/p. 23): I changed him from a normal man to a 3rd level expert.\n\nBACKGROUND\nThe adventures in this module take place in or near the town of Restenford, a fishing port on the Isle of Lendore’s southernmost peninsula. The entire island is not depicted in the maps in this module, but all pertinent features are detailed. Lendore Isle is covered with vegetation of all kinds and enjoys a mild climate, varying from semi-tropical warmth in the north (heated by the prevailing warm-water currents) to a more temperate and seasonal south. The island, as are all the Spindrift chain, is populated by scattered communities of humans, demi-humans, and humanoids.\n\nNotes for the Dungeon Master\n\nThis module is designed for novice and intermediate level players. The number of player characters should be between two and eight. The recommended level of character experience is from second to fourth level. Magical items available to the party at the start of the adventure should likewise be restricted. Players may either bring in existing characters of the appropriate level, with the DM’s approval, roll up new characters as suggested in Character Creation section of the Player’s Handbook or the DM may wish to use the party of pre-rolled characters included at the end of this module.\n\nA random encounter chart is given below that can easily apply to any large sections of the Isle. All monsters encountered are considered passers-by and are not inhabitantsof the specific area being investigated. This chart is applicable to most encounters on open grassland, in forests, or on smaller hills. Some forests and many mountains have specific populations that will be described, in addition to any encounters.\n\nThe chance for a random encounter is one out of six (i.e., a 1 on d6). A check should be made three times per day and once each night.\n\nRandom Wilderness Encounter Chart \n\nDie Roll\t\tEncounter\t\t\n1–5\t\tStirge (2–12)\n6–14\t\tWolf (2–8)\n15–17\t\tWorg (1–6)\n18–20\t\tAnt, giant, worker (3–18)\n21–24\t\tBear, black (1–2)\n25–27\t\tAnhkheg (1)\n28–30\t\tBoar (1)\n31–35\t\tBeetle, giant, bombardier (1–3)\n36–40\t\tCentipede, small monstrous (2–7)\n41–50\t\tRat, dire (2–12)\n51–57\t\tSnake, constrictor (1–6)\n58–60\t\tSnake, medium-size viper (1–3)\n61–67\t\tSpider, medium-size monstrous (2–7)\n68–70\t\tHalfling warrior(2–6)\n71–77\t\tElf warrior (2–8)\n78–81\t\tDwarf warrior (2–8)\n82–85\t\tGnome warrior (2–8)\n86–95\t\tBandit (rogue) (3–8)\n96–00\t\tBrigand (warrior) (2–12)\n\nHuman or demi-human bands of five or more individuals will be led by a leader of 2–5 level ability. Human leaders have a 10% chance of being a fighter, rather than a warrior. A dwarven leader will be a fighter. An elvish leader will be a fighter/wizard of matching levels. A gnomish leader will be an illusionist. A halfling leader will be a fighter/rogue of matching levels.\n\nRumors and facts: The following list is a compilation of various stories, rumors, and facts concerning Restenford and the surrounding area. Any resident of the area might know one or  more of these tales. Some of them are absolutely true, some are partially true, and others are utterly false. Those that are partially true will have the false statement(s) italicized. Men-at-arms and commoners will not know any of these tales. Only individuals with one or more levels will know any of these stories. The DM also may select which rumors a particular individual might impart. Giving a rumor is not a blatant action. Someone will not just run up to the party in an inn, recite a rumor, and then walk back to his or her table. The party must interact with the person before a tale will be revealed. Individuals basically friendly to the party will not lie about a rumor (i.e.,  distort it even more). Those hostile to the party, and that does not necessarily mean only evil individuals, might distort a rumor or lie to mislead the party. Characters above 3rd level have a chance of correcting an incorrect or false tale. This chanceis based on proximity to the tale’s source and knowledge of the same. If therumor concerns a person in the town, only another town resident will be able to make the correction. The base chance to make a correction is 10% per level of the character. The chance to know one or more rumors is as follows:\n\n\nChance of Knowing the Number of Rumors Given\nChar.\t1\t\t2\t\t3\t\t4\t\t5\t\t\nLevel\trumor\trumors\trumors\trumors\trumors\tnone\n1.\t1–40\t\t41–50\t\t51\t\t—\t\t—\t\t52–00\n2.\t1–55\t\t56–66\t\t67–68\t\t—\t\t—\t\t69–00\n3.\t1–70\t\t71–82\t\t83–85\t\t—\t\t—\t\t86–00\n4.\t1–70\t\t71–83\t\t84–87\t\t88\t\t—\t\t89–00\n5.\t1–70\t\t71–84\t\t85–89\t\t90–91\t\t—\t\t92–00\n6.\t1–70\t\t71–85\t\t86–91\t\t92–94\t\t—\t\t95–00\n7.\t1–80\t\t61–76\t\t77–85\t\t86–91\t\t92–94\t\t95–00\n8.\t1–60\t\t61–78\t\t79–91\t\t92–97\t\t98–00\t\t—\n9.\t1–50\t\t51–70\t\t71–86\t\t87–94\t\t95–00\t\t—\n\nNote: The Baron-Champion, the Druid, the Wizard, and the Abbot in Restenford know one tale per level. The High Priest in the Church of the Big Gamble also knows one tale per level. The option to disclose a rumor is always up to the DM. A person might not tell everything he or she knows.\n\nOnce a rumor is told you may substitute others.

I saw him drinking by the lake near Spring Glade.\n00\tThe Pebble Hills are a perfectly safe place to make a camp outside of Restenford.\n\nTHE WILDERNESS\n\nEach outdoor location is formatted to make finding necessary information easy and fast. The material is laid out as follows:\n\nLOCATION NAME\n\nFeature:\nInhabitants:\nLair of Major Inhabitants:\nEncounter Chances:\nAction:\nRoster detail:\n\nLocation Name will correspond to one or more named places on the map. A number/letter system is not used because it is easier to relate to a named location. This also adds more depth to play. There are just over  20 named places, and the DM will become familiar with them rapidly. A key is provided on the map.\n\nFeature is a statement of the flora and topography of the hill. forest, valley, spring, river, etc.\n\nInhabitants is a statement of fauna, including humans, demihumans, humanoids, monsters, normal animals, etc. A plant monster would be listed here.\n\nLair of Major Inhabitants refers to those inhabitants that can be helpful or harmful to the party. Thus the locations of bird’s nests, squirrels’ lairs, snake holes, etc. are not given and are not important. Ordinary innocuous animals are not given. However, a pack of foxes that might attack a party or a wounded adventurer would be located.\n\nEncounter chances gives a percentage chance of meeting the fauna that lives in/on the feature. Various obvious formats are used. One format does not always apply well to all situations. In general, the time of day will play a part in encounter situations.\n\nAction is a statement of what the principal inhabitant(s) will do if an encounter does occur. The DM always has the option to change the action section as he or she sees fit.\n\nRoster detail provides information on armor class, hit points, damage potential, number of attacks, treasure, hit dice, level, spells, magic items, etc.\n\nOne or more of the above categories may be omitted in some cases.\n\n\nDWEOMER FOREST\n\nFeature: The forest is typical; oak, beech, elm, and ash with a few laurel-leaf trees on the southern border. Herbaceous life is plentiful. Paths seem natural and not man-made. In the center of the forest, roughly a circle of one mile diameter, the trees change to walnut, maple, cherry, and apple. Flowers are also very abundant. A small knoll can be seen at the head of this clump of trees. This knoll is treeless but there are numerous bushes. In spring and fall, these bear a small, pale green flower; in summer and winter, a dark green berry. If the berries are eaten, the person will be violently sick for 2–7 days. If the forest is entered during the winter this circle and knoll will be found to always stay above 60¡  F. even if snow is falling elsewhere. The knoll is about 1000 feet in diameter and rises 60 feet above the forest floor. It is dome-shaped, and atop it can be seen another small dome that is the shape of an egg cut  lengthwise about 40 feet tall and 60 feet in diameter.\n\nInhabitants: At the forest edge numerous small animals canbe seen; a lone falcon, small birds of many types (quail, thrushes, wrens, swallows, etc.), squirrels, hares, raccoons, and foxes.\n\nIn the inner circle, animal life is quite dense. Atop the knoll is the Church of the Big Gamble. It is devoted to Norebo, the god of Luck, Gambling, and Risks (AL CN; Chaos, Luck, Trickery). The holy symbol is a pair of 8-sided dice. Administering its services are  a 10th level high priest, a 9th level high priestess, and five 4th level assistant clergy. These individuals are detailed below.\n\nEncounter Probabilities:100% to observe birds and animals. It is 40% likely that such an animal, including the foxes, falcon, or raccoons, will come to the party and beg for food. This chance increases to 90% if the party makes camp. On the hill itself it is 35% likely that a party member will see one of the clerics. If the church is entered, the probability of encounter increases to 100%.\n\nAction:  The animals will warn the high priestess as soon as someone enters the forest. There will not be a hostile reaction by the clergy if no harm is done to the animals on the hill itself. Picking flowers or taking berries (in moderation)is acceptable. The interaction of the clergy and the service of the church is explained hereafter.\n\nRoster detail:\n\nFaldelac the High Priest: Male Human Cleric (Norebo) 10; CR 10; Medium-Size Humanoid; HD 10d8+20; hp 68; Init +3 (Dex); Spd 30 ft.; AC 20 (+3 Dex, +7 bracers of armor); Atk +10/+5 melee (1d8+3, heavy mace +3—Construct Bane); SA spells; SQ turn undead; SA spells; AL CN; SV Fort +7, Ref +8, Will +13; Str 11, Dex 17, Con 15, Int 14, Wis 19, Cha 14.

(Telmar’s domains are Chaos and Luck.)\n\nThe egg-shaped building stands 40 ft. x 60 ft. x 18 ft. high. It has six windows of one-way glass-steel. Its door is made of solid stone and when it closes it locks via a special enchantment which is not affected by knock spells; a dispel magic will destroy the enchantment, leaving the huge stone door in place, however. Inside are three rooms; a large outer service room taking up half the building and two smaller back rooms (private quarters) which have doors opening into the main room.\n\nIn the service room can be seen a square dais of seven steps, atop which is a lectern. Resting on the lectern is a closed book. The back of the lectern is covered by a drape. Neither the book nor the lectern can be reached without standing on the dais. There are four 3 ft. square tables arranged in a square around the dais (a top view of the configuration is like the pips on a d6 when a Cfive” is rolled). Each table has four square stone benches around it.\n\nStepping on the dais automatically closes and locks the door. A bell will ring in the back rooms and the clergy will come in for a Cservice” after a pause of 2–8 rounds. Naturally they will fight if attacked, using their most powerful spells. if the book is taken off the dais a loud scream will be heard and the clergy will rush out, even if they are not fully armed or armored.\n\nIf not attacked, the clergy will invite the party to take seats at the tables and sit among the party after going to the High Priest at the lectern and receiving from him a leather cup containing two ivory and jade Cpercentile” dice.\n\nThe party will be asked to split up so that at least one party member and one cleric can be at each table. The High Priest will call upon the High Priestess to aid him. He will then produce a pitcher of wine and will fill as many of the small wooden cups (there are 20 in all) as he needs for each person present, including himself and the High Priestess. The wine is produced from the bushes that have the green berries/flowers and produces a state of mild intoxication after imbibing just one small cupful. After each person has imbibed, the High Priest will read from the scripture:  COh, Master of Lots, bring the Divine Intervention in my behalf this day; all praise to thee, who controls the Destiny of Wagerers!”, or COh, God of Chance, may the dodecahedrons of fate come up naught-naught!”, etc. (add prayers as you see fit along this line). The pitcher itself is worth 200 gp, the dice 100 gp per pair. While Cthe Word”  is being read, the clerics will engage the party in gambling. A stake of 1 gp must be put into the pot. The limit on a bet is 5 gp. Three rounds of rolls will then occur. High roll wins, ties double the pot. Each winner at a table, if more than one exists, will roll off against the other winner(s) at his or her table until a single winner (one per table) will take all of his or her winnings to one of the tables. All mustbet, and those who are short must make up the difference or drop out, giving half to the church. Each winner rolls once to see who wins it all and will then gamble against the High Priest.\n\nThis temple is an important site for the party. The temple will help those who are not greedy and who do not try to turn the temple into a hostel. The clerics are an excellent source of information about Bone Hill and they can warn a party about it. They believe some undead are there, but they do not know the types or numbers. They might lay a quest  upon a party who offends them in some way (coming back to the church too often is 20% likely per return trip to upset the High Priest), possibly to destroy the monsters on the hill. They will expect the choice of the second best item gained by the party when the quest is fulfilled. The High Priest will use discern lie at the same time of questioning to be sure he is getting his choice from the spoils!\n\nThis temple has a storeroom for valuables beneath the High Priest’s and Priestess’ room. Only they know the words to deactivate the two blast glyphs of warding  placed on the door. The glyphs  will inflict 5d8 points of electrical damage to any meddler (Reflex save (DC 17) for half-damage). The temple treasure room contains 202 pp, 1304 gp, 880 ep, 1154 sp, and the following numbers and values of gems: 4 x 50 gp each, 6 x 75 gp, 8 x 100 gp, 9 x  250 gp, 3 x 500 gp, and 2 x 1000 gp.\n\nThe church might buy a magic item at 20% below normal value (see DUNGEON MASTER’S Guide, pp. 180–210) if it is useful to someone in the temple. Once friendly contact has been made, the clergy might be willing to sell the bestowal of some spells. These spells, and the cost of each usage, are: dispel magic, 850 gp; neutralize poison, 2300 gp; cure light wounds, 130 gp;cure critical wounds, 400 gp;commune, 3500 gp;  remove disease, 1500 gp. Bargaining for a lower price will not be successful. This is the best the party can hope for in the way of aid on their adventures in this area. if they attack the place, the DM must be ruthless!\n\nBALD HILL\nFeature:  The hill is covered by small plants of various types but trees are solitary and rare. The crest of the hill, nearly one-and-a-half miles by one mile, is dome-shaped and has virtually no vegetation. The land around the crest and down toward the roads and town of Restenford is quite rich. Crops of various types are planted at the base of Bald Hill up to the edge of the town. The most common crops are rice, soybeans, some wheat, and numerous small crops and spices.\n\nInhabitants:  Only small animals dwell here. Brown rats and snakes are quite common, as well as many species of birds. Two small orchards of cherry and apple trees also contain small mammals. A small band of thieves occasionally occupies a cave on the northern face ofthe hill in the direction of Xerbal mountains.\n\nEncounter Probability: In the fields during the day there is an 85% chance of encountering 3–12 persons of various ages tending to the crops in some way, but at night this chance is only 50%. Randomly select these individuals from Restenford homes L to Z (18 choices; roll 3d6), or the druid (#35), or the sellers of fresh foods (#29). Encounters in the fields will rarely be eventful. Remember that the farmers have little, if any, useful information.  Small animals and birds are common in the fields; the chances are 40% for 2–5 at night, 60% for 2–7 during the day. The band of thieves is 50% likely to be present in their cave. If that percent is rolled then they will likely take up an ambush position near the bridge of the East Restin River (in the forests on either side of the road) or near the road leading northeast out of town. The chances for laying the ambush in the forest is 75%; along the northeast road, 25%. A band will consist of 2–5 thieves.\n\nLair of Principal Inhabitants: On Bald Hill, the cave is located roughly one mile due north from the summit of the hill. The thieves will be on the face of Xerbal Mountain. In the small forest east of the East Restin River, when not in their cave lair. When in the Xerbal Mountain retreat they will not attack parties on the road.\n\nRoster detail: The band of thieves are orcs, led by two half-orc leaders.\n\nKrellus:Male Half-Orc Cleric (Gruumsh) 3/Fighter 4; CR 7; Medium-Size Humanoid (Orc); HD 3d8+4d10+7; hp 39; Init +5 (+1 Dex, +4 Improved Initiative); Spd 20 ft.

There also is a short sword +1, a scroll of dimension door (caster level 9), and a potion of gaseous form.\n\nGUARDIAN PEAK, LARK HILL, HIGH TOP, LOW POINT, REDDY FOREST.\n\nGeneral: These sites are often used as campgrounds by travelers, and for the purpose of this module they will be sites for special encounters. Four NPCs are given here and others may be added as the DM sees fit. Other hills and forests may also be added to this list if the DM desires. When each of these locations is entered/climbed,  roll the percentile dice and use the Random Encounter Table given at the beginning of the module. However, if a 68–00 is rolled, ignore the given result and substitute one of the NPC encounters listed under Roster Detail.\n\nFeatures: The hills and the depression among them all are grass-covered, with bushes and rock outcroppings every 50 to 300 feet. Small stands of trees are quite common The larger copses are shown on the map. The Reddy Forest is typical of the area. Herbaceous plants are common and thick.  A stand of walnut trees occupies most of the base of Low Point.\n\nInhabitants: As indicated by the Random Encounter Table. A d4 should be rolled, with 1 indicating that the table should be consulted. If the party makes a camp, they should make a check every six hours.\n\nRoster detail for Special Encounters(68–00 on the d% roll):\n\nTolvar: Male Human Wizard 3; CR 3; Medium-Size Humanoid; HD 3d4; hp 10; Init +2 (Dex); Spd 30 ft.; AC 14 (+2 Dex, +1 bracers of armor +1, +1  ring of protection +1); Atk +2 melee (1d4+1, 19–20/x2, dagger); SA spells; AL CN; SV Fort +1, Ref +3, Will +5; Str 13, Dex 14, Con 10, Int 16, Wis +2, Cha 8.\n\nSkills and Feats:Concentration +6, Hide (cc) +5, Knowledge (arcana) +9, Knowledge (local) +9, Search (cc) +5, Spellcraft +9; Alertness, Combat Casting, Combat Reflexes, Scribe Scroll.\nPossessions: Bracers of armor +1, ring of protection +1, dagger, pouch with 110 ep.\nSpells Prepared (4/3/2): 0—Flare, Light, Ray of Frost, Read Magic; 1st—Charm Person, Chill Touch, Sleep; 2nd—Glitterdust, Invisibility.\n\nTolvar is an adventurer down on his luck.

He will submit todetect evil,  (masking the attempt). He will say that the particulars of his philosophy are his business, but that he is not evil. He is very unlikely to murder a  party member, even for a quick gain, but if an animosity builds up between a player character and himself he might then try to do him or her in. If the party saves his life in a direct manner he will be loyal, as he is highly lawful. If the party has toomany characters of good alignment, especially chaotic good, he will likely drift away after an adventure, perhaps taking a good item with him.\n\nDM Note: It is recommended that whenever a henchman is added to the party that the Dungeon Master not simply rattle off the character’s statistics, magic items, and other abilities. A henchman will tell his or her boss about himself/herself but will not lay out his or her life for a perfect stranger. Once a few adventures have occurred, he will be freer with information about himself/herself. Obviously this is even more true of a hireling. The DM must not let the party know more than what is reasonable. If a player is given the character to portray, the DM must have the final veto over any action of the hireling or henchman. The DM should tell the player what he or she needs to know to portray the character but reserve the right to release data on that individual as necessary.\n\nPEBBLE HILLS, TRI-TOP, KELMAN WOODS, SPRING GLADE.\n\nGeneral: This part of the Kelman Hills is occupied by a band of gnolls and a pack of wolves. The gnolls have some small control over the wolves but often operate independently.\n\nFeatures: The hills are quite rocky, and boulders are very common (naturally!). Grasses grow in clumps, as do bushes.  Large sections of the hills are sandy or rocky with no plant growth whatsoever. The few small copses of trees are normal forests with abundant bushes. The Kelman Woods is a typical forest, but evergreens, oaks and laurels are thick along the coast and common up to a half-mile into the forest. Spring Glade is quite luxurious. It is partially watered by the large lake, which is fed by underground streams running from the hills. The trees are very large and old, some standing over 100 feet tall. Herbaceous growth is not as thick as in some of the forests of the southern peninsula, but mosses are very common and thick.\n\nPrincipal Inhabitants:Random encounters with animals and other creatures are not common here. When using the Random Encounter Table,  only a 1 rolled on a d10 will indicate an encounter. The gnoll band is made up of six adult males, three adult females, and eleven children. There is also a wolf pack of three worg leaders, nine dire wolves, and a dozen young cubs\n\nLair of Principal Inhabitants: The gnolls have a lair in the valley among the peaks of Tri-Top. It is a small town of six stone huts. The wolf pack has a lair in the Kelman Woods at the very base of Tri-Top within 200 feet of the woods’ edge.\n\nEncounter Probability:For small animals, the probability is 10%. There is also a chance of an encounter from the Random Encounter Table,  according to the party's location and using the table below. Consider the chance of encounter to be equal at day or nighttime, though the DM might wish to change the given percentage chances.\n\nWILDERNESS ENCOUNTER TABLE\n\n\tChance of\nLocation\tEncounter\tEncounter\nRoad near Kellman Woods\t20%\t2–5 wolves, 1 worg\nRoad from woods to\t\t1–4 gnolls (at least\n  Kelman Pass\t40%\t1 adult male), 1–4 wolves\nAlong road from Kelman\n  Pass to Tri-Top\t55% \t2–7 gnolls (at least\n\t\t1 adult male)\nPebble Hills\t65%\t1–4 gnolls (at least\n\t1 adult male)\nTri-Top (except lair)\t80%\t3–8 gnolls (any type)\nTri-Top lair\t100%\t5–20 gnolls, 1 ogre\nNear the lake\t35%\t1–4 gnolls, 1–4 wolves\nSpring Glade\t15%\t1–2 gnolls or 1–2 wolves\nSpring Valley\t30%\t1–3 gnolls, 1–3 wolves\nKelman Woods (within\n  mile of wolf lair)\t100%\t3–12 wolves (including\n\t\tworgs), 7–12 cubs\nKelman Woods\t40%\t3–8 wolves, 1 worg\n  (remaining area)\n\nTo determine each member of a gnoll band, roll a d20; a result of 1–6 indicates an adult male, 7–10 an adult female, and 11–20 a gnoll child. When Cat least one adult male”  gnoll is specified, include a male even if the second die roll produces no adult. For the wolf pack, a d12 is rolled, with 1–3 indicating a worg, 4–12 a dire wolf. Wolves, however, should always outnumber any worgs by a 2:1 margin in any pack.\n\nAction:  The wolves and gnolls are hungry for wealth and food. However, they only will attack from concealment and only if they have a numerical superiority or equality with the party. If the ogre is present they might attack if they are down by only one or two persons. If they are too weak to attack they will go for help. The wolves can contact the gnolls by howling and the gnolls can contact thewolves by blowing a horn. The fact that this alerts their prey does not alarm them since they will likely attack with a large numerical superiority once reinforcements arrive. They will not go into the Dead Forest, nor will they go into the northern portion of the Kelman Hills.\n\nRoster detail: There are 20 gnolls here:\nSix male adults: CR 1; Medium-Size Humanoid (Gnoll); HD 2d8+2; hp 17, 17, 16, 16, 15, 15; Init +0; Spd 20 ft.

The young gnolls have no treasure. There is additional treasure in the gnoll lair. The huts form a circle with the boss’  hut in the center. The perimeter huts contain the following: #1, 31 gp, 48 ep, 13 sp; #2, 138 ep; #3, 26 ep and apotion of cure serious wounds;  #4, 71 gp, 38 ep; #5, gems: 4 x 75 gp, 1 x 100 gp. All of this treasure is hidden (Search, DC 20). In the ogre’s cave is 13 pp, 280 gp, 670 sp, and gems: 10 x 50 gp, a small steel shield +1, a  battleaxe +1, two potions of cure light wounds, and a wand of magic missile (7 charges).\n\nWithin the wolf pack lair is no treasure, but there are the bodies of three victims within 1000 feet of the lair. The bodies are lying apart from one another. Body #1, elf; in its purse are 28 gp, 23 sp, and a special ring of invisibility that functions for only one hour at a time once every 24 hours (Market Value: 10,000 gp). Body #2, human; in its purse are 3 pp, 8 gp, a  potion of spider climb, and it wears scale mail +1. Body #3, dwarf; in its purse are 31 gp, 9 sp, and a set of masterwork thieves’ tools.\n\nBONE HILL AND THE DEAD FOREST\n\nFeature:  The hill rises to a height of over 1400 feet. Atop it are the remains of a ruined castle, which can be seen by those of keen eye. The hill itself is rocky, and boulders large enough to conceal a mounted knight occur frequently (every 800 to 1500 feet) with other large formations within 2500 feet of the ruin. The area around the ruin is level, with the large rocks and boulders deliberately removed. The hill has wild grasses and shrubs growing about its base, but near the 1200-foot mark and higher there is virtually no vegetation. This is unusual, as the hill should abound with plant life. Within 3000 feet of the ruin there are no large bushes and no plant cover (Wilderness Lore, DC 20, note that the land has been cleared often and recently). The forest is typical of the area with respect to plant life. Bushes are abundant, and trails and natural passages are few. However, no animal life is  seen (see below).\n\nInhabitants: The hill/ruin is occupied by a symbiosis, though not all the partners are Calive.” During the day the ruin’s upper level is guarded by a band of bugbears (6 adult males, 5 adult females, and 9 young) supportedby an evil magician. Two of the bugbears are shamans. At night the ruin is run by the undead—a wraith, a zombire, a skelter, 8 zombies, and 12 skeletons (the zombire and skelter are defined below). Other monsters exist in the lower ruin levels, but since they are not mobile and never venture outside, they will be discussed as they are encountered. In the forest normal small mammals and birds are not to be seen. Insect life, though, is very widespread, including such creatures as wasps, flies, bees, and locusts. There is  a 15% chance of encountering 1–2 normal-sized poisonous vipers (see below). Finally, strange forms of undead may be encountered There is a 1 in 6 chance per turn of an encounter from the following table (roll 1d6 for the exact result):\n\n1–3\tNormal skeletons (2–12)\n4–5\tAnimal skeletons (2–8)\n6\tGhoulstirges (2–8)\n\nLair of Major Inhabitants:  The ruin, as shown on the map of above-ground levels, is home for the bugbears, magic-user, and undead. The forest has no actual lairs, but there is a strong likelihood of encountering wandering monsters (see below).\n\nEncounter Probability:The hill—Below 1200 feet of elevation, (i.e.  no closer than 2500 feet to the ruin,) there is a 1 in 6 chance of an encounter (check every half-mile traveled by the party). This encounter will be either a lone skeleton (60%) or zombie (40%) lurking behind a boulder. These encounters are not part of the ruin population.\n\nWithin 2500 feet of the ruin the chances of a dangerous encounter increases, as modified by the time of day. In daytime, there is a 1 in 10 chance (check each turn) of meeting a lone bugbear going to the ruin. He is not part of the ruin population but is seeking employment. He only knows that some of his fellows work here; he does not know how many are here, who runs the complex, or of the presence of the undead. At night there is a 1 in 4 chance of an encounter (check each turn). The following table should be used to determine the creature(s) encountered whenever an encounter is indicated:\n\n1\tWasp, Giant (1)\n2\tScorpion, Giant (1)\n3\tCentipede, Giant (1–3)\n4\tViper, Poisonous (1–3)\n5–6\tGhoulstirges (1–4)\n\nGiant wasp: CR 3; Large Vermin; HD 5d8+10; Init +1 (Dex); Spd 20 ft., fly 60 ft.

An attached ghoulstirge has an AC of 13; Blood Drain (Ex)—A ghoulstirge drains blood, dealing 1d6 points of temporary Con damage each round it remains attached. Once it has drained 6 points of Con, it detaches and flies off to digest the meal; Paralysis (Ex)—Those hit by a ghoulstirge’s touch attack must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC 14) or be paralyzed for 1d6+1 minutes. Elves are immune to this paralysis.\nSQ: Undead—Immune to mind-influencing effects, poison, sleep, paralysis, stunning, and disease. Not subject to critical hits, subdual damage, ability damage, energy drain, or death from massive damage; Turn Resistance (Ex)—+2.\n\nThe ghoulstirges are 70% likely to guard a nearby treasure (on the body of a former victim). The treasure will contain 6–60 gp, 8–80 ep, and is 40% likely to also contain either a miscellaneous potion or scroll with 1–4 1st and 2nd level clerical spells.\n\nAnimal skeleton: CR 1/6; Tiny Undead; HD 1/4 d12; Init +5 (+1 Dex, +4 Improved Initiative); Spd30 ft.; AC 13 (+2 size, +1 Dex); Atk +0 melee (1d3–2, bite); Face 2 1/2 ft. x 2 1/2 ft.; Reach 0 ft.; SQ undead, immunities; AL N; SV Fort +0, Ref +1, Will +2; Str 6, Dex 12, Con —, Int —, Wis 10, Cha 1.\n\nFeats: Improved Initiative.\nSQ: Undead—Immune to mind-influencing effects, poison, sleep, paralysis, stunning, and disease. Not subject to critical hits, subdual damage, ability damage, energy drain, or death from massive damage; Immunities (Ex)—Skeletons have cold immunity. Because they lack flesh or internal organs, they take only half damage from piercing or slashing weapons.\n\nThey will be of small mammals such as hares, squirrels, oppossums, rats, foxes, etc. As with normal skeletons, these undead will attack until destroyed or turned. They have no treasure.\n\nAction: Every creature in or under these ruins hates and fears living beings, and thus they will jealously guard their treasure troves and seek at every opportunity to destroy any intruders. The wraith was once a mighty, evil warlord who now acts in concert with the magic-user to further its own hate-filled purposes. Likewise, the skelter and zombire who roam this site (detailedbelow) are unique beings, once utterly evil henchman of the wraith in life but then physically destroyed and cursed with undead forms, sustained by the powerful evil of this ancient and diabolical spot.\n\nRoster detail: The Ruin.\nTelvar: Male Human Wizard 6; CR 6; Medium-Size Humanoid; HD 6d4+6; hp 27; Init +6 (+2 Dex, +4 Improved Initiaitve); Spd 30 ft.; AC 12 (+2 Dex); Atk +4 melee (1d4, 19–20/x2, masterwork dagger); SA spells; AL CE; SV Fort +5, Ref +7, Will +9; Str 10, Dex 14, Con 13, Int 16, Wis 12, Cha 8.\n\nSkills and Feats: Alchemy +12, Concentration +10, Knowledge (arcana) +12, Knowledge (astrology) +9, Scry +5, Spellcraft +12; Alertness, Brew Potion, Combat Casting, Improved Initiative, Scribe Scroll, Toughness.\nPossessions: Cloak of resistance +2, masterwork dagger, wand of fear (5 charges).\nSpells Prepared (4/4/4/3): 0—Daze, Detect Magic, Ray of Frost, Read Magic; 1st—Magic Missile, Protection From Good, Ray of Enfeeblement, Sleep; 2nd—Darkness, Detect Thoughts, Invisibility, See Invisbility; 3rd—Dispel Magic, Fireball, Protection From Arrows.\n\nIf possible, Telvar will activate both protection spells prior to an encounter.

Not subject to critical hits, subdual damage, ability damage, energy drain, or death from massive damage, Partial Actions Only (Ex)—Zombies have poor reflexes and can only perform partial actions. Thus they can move or attack, but can only do both if they charge (a partial charge).\n\nObservation from the ruin: Whenever a party approaches the ruin, there is a chance they will be spotted by a watchful guard. The table below gives the percentage chance of a party being spotted if it approaches within 2500 feet of any given location, as modified by day or night conditions. If the party is spotted, the alarm will be raised in the ruin within 2–8 turns, after which time surprising its inhabitants will be impossible. Note: if the party takes precautionary evasive action as it proceeds (darting from concealment to concealment, hiding behind cover as it advances, etc.) then the chances of being observed are modified by 20% in the party’s favor. At night, using bright lights such as torches guarantees being observed.\n\nRuin\nlocation\tDay\tNight\nA\t\t10%\t60%\nB\t\t50%\t40%\nD\t\t10%\t20%\nE\t\t30%\t55%\nF\t\t70%\t45%\nG\t\t75%\t50%\nM\t\t20%\t20%\nT\t\t95%\t75%\nU\t\t95%\t75%\nV\t\t50%\t50%\nW\t\t80%\t50%\nX\t\t90%\t80%\nZ\t\t80%\t50%\n\nENCOUNTER KEY TO BONE HILL\n\nA.\tTHE TOWER.\n\nThis tower has three levels and a roof. A huge 10 ft. x 12 ft. hole is at ground level on the northwest face. The outer walls are quite secure structurally; only a very severe blow would cause any further opening in the breach. There is virtually no chance  the tower would collapse. The inside structure, however, including the roof, is very old and rotted. The staircases are made of stone and built into the wall, and will not collapse unless the wall caves in. Each 10 ft. x 10 ft. section of floor and roof can support 100 lbs. of weight safely. Each three pounds of additional weight means a 1% chance of causing the flooring/roof to collapse, taking along any floors below as it falls.  A falling character will take 2d6 points of damage per level fallen, with a 70% chance of the character being hit by 1–4 large stones for 1–6 additional points of damage each. Once collapse begins, a character can attempt to jump (DC 17) to a staircase. Those characters on a staircase when a floor above falls in have a 60% chance of being hit by 1–4 stones. Items carried that are not in packs or belt pouches must make a Reflex save (DC 15) for every 7 points of damage taken by the owning player.\n\nIn the floor of the second level is a secret compartment which can be found by inspection from above (Search, DC 20), unless this floor collapses, in which case from 3–30 gp will rain down amid the rubble. Investigation will reveal the balance of 250 gp still in the intact floor sections along with a pouch containing a ring of feather falling.\n\nThe lowest level of the tower is always occupied by undead: 2–20 might be present. They sally forth only at night, but if a melee is in progress they will come out to aid the bugbears or the magic-user. The procedure for determining these undead is, first roll 2d10 for quantity, the 1d20 for type: 1–3 indicates animal skeletons, 4–8 normal zombies, 9–13 normal skeletons and 14–20 a mixed force of skeletons and zombies as the DM sees fit. Subtract all undead losses from the provided roster. The living never enter the tower.\n\nA stairway leads down from the first level to room AJ.\n\nB.\tCOLLAPSED WALL.\n\nThis is a section of collapsed wall. Among the rubble are a number of nearly spherical rocks of roughly one-foot diameter, with some split into fragments. A catapult once hurled these at the wall. A lone bugbear will be on guard here 70% of the time. In the rubble is a skeleton, not part of the roster,\n\nSkeleton: CR 1/3; Medium-Size Undead; HD 1d12; hp 7; Init +5 (+1 Dex, +4 Improved Initiative); Spd 30 ft.; AC 13 (+1 Dex, +2 natural); Atk +0 melee (1d4 [x2], 2 claws); SQ undead, immunities; AL N; SV Fort +0, Ref +1, Will +2; Str 10, Dex 12, Con —, Int —, Wis 10, Cha 1.\n\nFeats: Improved Initiative.\n\nIt will attack anything that crosses the rubble, except a bugbear. The skeleton is the remains of one of four bodies here, none of which has any treasure. The skeleton is on guard both day and night. It can be noted that the animated skeleton is a bugbear, while the other bones are of elves.\n\nC.\tSIEGE TOWER.\n\nThis is the remains of a siege tower, fallen and rotting, with many sections burnt away. The tower is at the center of a 40 ft. diameter circle of scorched ground (marking the use of a fireball) and some darkening can be seen on the wall. The charred bones of three bugbears can be seen amid the ruin. If the siege tower is partially moved a secret trap door might be revealed (DC 20) leading to location BA,  below.\n\nD.\tCOURTYARD.\n\nThis is the heart of the courtyard. A 40 ft. diameter circle of burnt remains (left from afireball) can be seen. Within this circle are seven skeletons; 4 humans and 3 bugbears. None of them are animated. From 1–4 undead might be on patrol here at night (they will be mixed types from the roster).\n\nE.\tGUARD TOWER.\n\nThe old guard tower is not used by the bugbears, but there is a 70% chance a skeleton, zombie, or ghoulstirge might be here at night. Inside the tower is a special brass horn of Valhalla  in the hand of a bugbear skeleton lying in the corner. The horn is aligned with chaotic evil and will summon only barbarians of that alignment.\n\nBarbarians (2d4+1): Human Barbarian 3; CR 3; Medium-Size Humanoid; HD 3d12+3; Init: +2 (Dex); Spd 30 ft.; AC 15 (+2 Dex, +3 studded leather armor); Atk +6 melee (1d12+2, x3, greataxe), or +5 melee (1d4+2, 19–20/x2, dagger), or +5 ranged (1d6, x3, shortbow); SA rage; SQ uncanny dodge, immunities; AL CE; SV Fort +4, Ref +3, Will +2; Str 15, Dex 14, Con 13, Int 10, Wis 12, Cha 8.\n\nSkills and Feats: Climb +8 (+9), Wilderness Lore +8, Listen +8, Jump +8 (+9), Spot (cc) +4 1/2; Alertness, Dodge, Weapon Focus (greataxe).\nSA: Rage (Ex)—once per day.\nSQ: Uncanny Dodge (Ex)—Dex bonus to AC; Immunities (Su)—The summoned barbarians are immune to charm and hold spells.\nPossessions: Dagger, greataxe, shortbow with 20 arrows, studded leather armor. \n\nThese warriors will attack any but chaotic evil individuals when summoned. (The bugbears and magician would love to find this treasure, naturally, since they could use it, but they don’t come here because the undead occupy it at times.)\n\nF.\tGATEWAY.\n\nHere are the remains of a battering ram and the old portcullis that fell on top of it. Six skeletons lie in the rubble, one of which is animated,\n\nSkeleton:  CR 1/3; Medium-Size Undead; HD 1d12; hp 6; Init +5 (+1 Dex, +4 Improved Initiative); Spd 30 ft.; AC 13 (+1 Dex, +2 natural); Atk +0 melee (1d4 [x2], 2 claws); SQ undead, immunities; AL N; SV Fort +0, Ref +1, Will +2; Str 10, Dex 12, Con —, Int—, Wis 10, Cha 1.\n\nFeats: Improved Initiative.\n\nDuring the day there is a 10% chance of encountering a bugbear here not on the roster.\n\nBugbear:  CR 2; Medium-Size Humanoid (Goblinoid); HD 3d8+3; hp 22; Init +1 (Dex); Spd 30 ft.; AC 17 (+1 Dex, +3 natural, +2 leather armor, +1 small wooden shield); Atk +4 melee (1d8+2, morningstar), or +3 ranged (1d6+2, javelin); SQ darkvision; AL CE; SV Fort +2, Ref +4, Will +1; Str 15, Dex 12, Con 13, Int 10, Wis 10, Cha 9.\n\nSkills and Feats: Climb +2, Hide +3, Listen +3, Move Silently +6, Spot +3; Alertness.\nPossessions: Javelin (2), leather armor, morningstar, pouch with 1–12 gp.\n\nG.\tCOLLAPSED WALL\n\nThis portion of broken wall has been smashed by repeated hits from a catapult. Two elven skeletons lie in the rubble. If they are dug up, one will be found to be wearing a pair of boots of elvenkind. There is a 15% chance of encountering a bugbear here during the day (not on the roster).\n\nBugbear: CR 2; Medium-Size Humanoid (Goblinoid); HD 3d8+3; hp 24; Init +1 (Dex); Spd 30 ft.; AC 17 (+1 Dex, +3 natural, +2 leather armor, +1 small wooden shield); Atk +4 melee (1d8+2, morningstar), or +3 ranged (1d6+2, javelin); SQ darkvision; AL CE; SV Fort +2, Ref +4, Will +1; Str 15, Dex 12, Con 13, Int 10, Wis 10, Cha 9.\n\nSkills and Feats: Climb +2, Hide +3, Listen +3, Move Silently +6, Spot +3; Alertness.\nPossessions: Javelin (2), leather armor, morningstar, pouch with 1–12 gp.\n\nInside of the wall is an animated skeleton. It will not attack bugbears.\n\nSkeleton: CR 1/3; Medium-Size Undead; HD 1d12; hp7; Init +5 (+1 Dex, +4 Improved Initiative); Spd 30 ft.; AC 13 (+1 Dex, +2 natural); Atk +0 melee (1d4 [x2], 2 claws); SQ undead, immunities; AL N; SV Fort +0, Ref +1, Will +2; Str 10, Dex 12, Con —, Int —, Wis 10, Cha 1.\n\nFeats: Improved Initiative.\n\nH.\tTHE CATAPULT.\n\nThese are the remains of a catapult, rotting with age. Amid the rubble is an animated hill giant skeleton.\n\nSkeleton (hill giant): CR 1; Medium-Size Undead; HD 2d12; hp 18; Init +5 (+1 Dex, +4 Improved Initiative); Spd 40 ft.; AC 13 (–1 size,  +1 Dex, +3 natural); Atk +2 melee (1d6+2 [x2], 2 claws); SQ undead, immunities; AL N; SV Fort +0, Ref +1, Will +2; Str 14, Dex 12, Con —, Int —, Wis 10, Cha 1.\n\nFeats: Improved Initiative.\nPossessions: Pouch with 72 ep and 6 x 20 gp gems.\n\nI.\tCASTLE HALL.\n\nThis is the entrance hall. The castle itself has taken very little damage save the hole at location M.  The walls and floors are intact and solid. The furniture in the entrance hall is damaged, though it once was apparently of very good quality. A large bar has been added to the outer double doors. The bar is always in place at night. It can be broken by a Str check (DC 25). During the day a bugbear (any age) is 20% likely to be here. At night this location serves as a guard post and is occupied by 1–2 bugbears (60% chance to be adults, 40% to be children). Even young bugbears are attentive on duty since the magician has killed more than one who had been lax in his duty.\n\nJ.\tGUARD POST.\n\nThis room used to be a guard post. Furniture has been removed, and every ten minutes there is a 7% chance of a bugbear wandering in.\n\nDM note: This wandering monster percentage is for normal situations. If an alert has been sounded the bugbears will take defensive positions in rooms J or K. The magician will be in room V, W, U, or Z, where he can cast a spell or use a wand at those in the courtyard or approaching the ruin.\n\nK.\tWAITING ROOM.\n\nThis is a waiting room with six chairs. Many of the chairs are damaged from improper care. A bugbear might wander in 12% of the time, the magician, 4%.\n\nL.\tARMORY.\n\nThis room’s door is reinforced with metal bands and has also been arcane locked  by the magician (DC 35 to break). The room was once a barracks and weapons room. The remains of six beds are here, and six footlockers. There is a weapon rack with 12 spears and 8 short bows on a wall (all the weapons are rotted and useless). The lockershave been opened and items have been strewn about.\n\nM.\tTHRONE ROOM.\n\nThis room was once the throne room. Its back wall was disintegrated along withthe throne long ago. The bugbear children often play here during the day, watched over by one of the females. The room was decorated by frescoes of men and elves fighting together against bugbears. These paintings have been defaced and partially destroyed.  The room’s door is barred from the other side (the side in room K) and is always in place at night.\n\nN.\tBARRACKS.\n\nThis room is used as a barracks for the bugbears. Three females and four males live here. They own no treasure other than the gold carried on their persons. If not on alert, there is an 85% chance of encountering 2–7 bugbears at night and a 55% chance for encountering 1–4 in the day.\n\nO.\tSHAMAN’S QUARTERS.\n\nThis room is the quarters for the first bugbear shaman and his wife (the other shaman and his wife live in room P). This shaman possesses two blocks ofincense of meditation  mixed with, but distinguishable from, eight ordinary blocks of incense. This treasure is in an iron chest along with seven gems worth 10 gp each. The chance of encountering the bugbears living here is 40% in the day for 1–2, and 80% at night for both.\n\nP.\tSHAMAN’S QUARTERS.\n\nThis room is lived in by the second bugbear shaman and his wife. He possesses a scroll of four spells: spiritual weapon, prayer, discern lie,and tongues  (caster level 5). There is a chest in the room containing his treasure, 240 gp. It is guarded by a blast glyph of warding  placed there long ago by a friendly companion shaman. It will explode for 2d8 points of fire damage affecting everyone in the room unless a Reflex save is made for half damage (DC 15).\n\nQ.\tPANTRY.\n\nMost of the good food once here has long ago been eaten. What remains is mostly trail rations made for bugbear tastes. There are few fresh foods.\n\nR.\tKITCHEN.\n\nAny items of value once here have long ago been taken away.\n\nS. \tDINING ROOM.\t\n\nThe large table in this room has been marred and is partially rotted. The chairs likewise are badly marked and damaged. There is a 20% chance of encountering a wandering bugbear here. The door leading from this room to room M is nailed shut (DC 15 to break).\n\nT.\tSTORAGE ROOM.\n\nThis was formerly a storage room but is now a lookout post during the day. There is a 70% chance of encountering a bugbear here. The window is closed at night.\n\nU.\tCHILDREN’S OUARTERS.\n\nThis is the living quarters of the young bugbears. There is a 85% chance of encountering 2–9 in the day and a 95% chance of encountering 6–9 at night. An adult bugbear will be watching here 65% of the time during the day. The window shutters are closed at night.\n\nV.\tMAGICIAN'S BEDROOM.\n\nTelvar the magician sleeps and rests in this room. There is a secret door to room W, and a trap door leading up to room Z. They are both  arcane locked  (DC 28 to break). The windows are barred with steel (DC 28 to break) and are shuttered closed at night. This bedroom has been repaired and refurbished. It contains a large bed, a padded chair, a footlocker, a wardrobe, a four-drawer chest, and a portraitof the magician on the wall over the bed. The locker contains traveling clothes, none of which are magical. The wardrobe holds four robes and three cloaks, which are also normal clothing. Behind the portrait is a small secret compartment containing a pouch with 23 pp and 10 gems: 7 x 20 gp, 3 x 50 gp.\n\nTelvar may be found in any of the three rooms (V, W, Z) of the second and third floors, or he may be in a different part of the ruins altogether. The table below should be consulted to determine his exact location as soon as the party begins exploring this area (rolling d%).\n\nLocation\tNight\t\tDay\nRoom V\t1–49\t\t1–29\nRoom W\t50–69\t\t30–65\nRoom Z\t70–94\t\t66–85\nElsewhere in\t95–00\t\t86–00\nthe ruins\n\nW.\tWORKSHOP.\n\nThis room is the magician’s workshop. The door to it (as well as the secret door to V) is arcane locked.  It contains a large table with beakers, flasks, and general lab equipment. Telvar was an apprentice to an alchemist in his early youth and still enjoys experimenting with and mixing potions. On a series of shelves are forty bottles and flasks, and twelveof them hold magical potions or mixed potions. These twelve will radiate magic. The other bottles contain only common chemicals. Sixteen of them are harmless if imbibed but may leave an aftertaste for some hours. Mixing liquids in the stomach is never wise, and if someone is sofoolish as to do so then a mild or toxic poison could result (roll d%; 1–60 produces no ill effect, 61–90 arsenic (DC 13; primary damage 1 temporary Con; secondary damage 1d8 temporary Con), 91–00 potion of poison (DC 16; primary damage 1d10 temporary Con;  secondary damage 1d10 temporary Con). The remaining 12 bottles will produce poisoning effects upon drinking automatically. They are filled with arsenic (DC 13; primary damage 1 temporary Con; secondary damage 1d8 temporary Con).\n\nThe eight magic potions are:\n\n1.\tA normal potion of cure moderate wounds.\n2.\tAnpotion of cure moderate wounds mixed with a potion of reduce.  A sample will produce noticeable curing but the shrinking effect can be noticed by the drinker with a Spot check (DC 15) or by another person of the party with aSpot check (DC 17). If the full potion is imbibed the curing effect is complete but diminution will reduce the person to 50% of his or her normal size. Alas, his or her gear will not shrink at all. The shrinking will last for 30 minutes.\n3.\tA normal potion of Charisma.\n4\tApotion of polymorph self crossed with a potion of truth.  This one was a real discovery, but when tested it will give no indication of its nature other than a Cgood feeling,” a Cwarm tingling,” or Can unexplained desire.”  When fully imbibed, the figure will become nervous and excitable. He or she will want to do Csomething”  but will not know what it is. Caution will not be exercised. The very next living thing the character mentions, however, is what he or she will become! Character classes like wizard, fighter, etc. will not produce any change since profession is not a physical form. The effect will last for 2–12 days. Objects worn are allowed a Will save (DC 13) or they become part of the polymorph unless the alteredform is one that wears similar gear under normal circumstances. The polymorphed form still has the same mind, but the abilities could be radically changed. If no form is named within 24 hours of game time no transformation will occur.\n5.\tA normal potion of enlarge.\n6.\tA normal potion of vision.\n7.\tApotion of gaseous form crossed with a potion of invisibility.  Testing this liquid will produce translucence in the entire figure. If the entire potion is consumed the figure will become gaseous and then vanish.His or her items will become gaseous as well. Obviously, he or she cannot communicate at all in this state. Vision is likewise slightly obscured. Hearing is quite impossible. Only taste and smell are fully activated. A vague sense of touch, especially temperature sensitivity, does exist. The character has a move of 20 ft. per round, slightly slower if penetrating a small hole, crack under a door, etc. After 20 miuntes theinvisibility  wears off and the cloud is visible. This cloud remains gaseous for a further 8 turns. The cloud can be damaged by lightning and magical fire, and a whirlwind does double damage.\n8.\tApotion of longevity crossed with apotion of haste.  A test sample will produce a craving for the rest unless a Will save (DC 15) is made. If the save is successful, the character will talk rapidly for a few minutes but will feel terribly robust and hardy. The full potion will cause the character to become5 years younger while being able to move at a 50% bonus for 30 rounds. The character must also, however, make two Fortitude saves (DC 12). If either check fails the character takes a total of 2–20 points of immediate damage.\n9–12.\tFour normal potions of poison.\n\nAlso hidden in this room, in a false back of the writing desk (normal writing equipment, blank scrolls, ink, brushes, etc. will be found in the drawers) is the magician’s spell book. The false back has a  magic mouth that screams CThief! Thief! Thief!” twenty times when the back is opened by anyone save Telvar. The book contains the following spells:\n\nSpellbook: 1st—Charm Person, Identify, Jump, Magic Missile, Protection From Good, Ray of Enfeeblement, Shocking Grasp, Sleep; 2nd—Arcane Lock, Darkness, Detect Invisibility, Detect Thoughts, Invisibility, Levitate, Magic Mouth; 3rd—Dispel Magic, Fireball, Fly, Gust of Wind, Leomund’s Tiny Hut, Protection From Arrows, Summon Monster III; 4th—Arcane Eye, Rary’s Mnemonic Enhancer.\n\nX.\tSTOREROOM.\n\nThis room contains books, boxes of magic supplies and papers, spare furniture, and other objects not frequently used or consulted by Telvar.\n\nY.\tSTOREROOM\n\nThis room is currently empty.\n\nZ.\tOBSERVATORY.\n\nThis room is used by Telvar for astrological observation. It has a ladder to the roof. The trap door at the top is locked and barred. It is reinforced with steel bands (DC 25). Inside the room is a crude but effective telescope. There is a large drawing table and some maps of the heavens dated on a month by month basis. Some curious Ccarvings” are on the roof (sighting lines and measurement points for celestial  observations). On one wall of the room is a dart board and 4 darts. The darts can be used as weapons.\n\nBASEMENT OF THE CASTLE\n\nIf any of the skeletons, zombies, or the skelter and zombire still exist they will be in this area. They know of the secret doors connecting AIto AJ and AE. They will occupy rooms AB, AC, AD, AE, AI, or AJ. First roll to see how many, if any, are in room A  on ground level. If any remain, disperse them randomly among the six named locations with no more than six in one room\n\nAA. THE GHOUL LAIR.\n\nThe doors to this room are locked so that the above-ground undead do not come in. The wraith (see below) does not enter this room. Its guardians are three ghouls and a ghast. They will attack any who enter from the doors or stairs but they will not followanyone out. Thus they can be bypassed through various means such as invisibility, turning undead successfully, etc.\n\nGhouls (3): CR 1; Medium-Size Undead; HD 2d12; hp 18, 15, 12; Init +2 (Dex); Spd 30 ft.; AC 14 (+2 Dex, +2 natural); Atk +3melee (1d6+1 and paralysis, bite) and +0 melee (1d3 and paralysis [x2], 2 claws); SA paralysis, create spawn; SQ undead, +2 turn resistance; AL CE; SV Fort +0, Ref +2, Will +5; Str 13, Dex 15, Con —, Int 13, Wis 14, Cha 16.\n\nSkills and Feats: Climb +6, Escape Artist +7, Hide +7, Intuit Direction +3, Jump +6, Move Silently +7, Search +6, Spot +7; Multiattack, Weapon Finesse (bite).\nSA: Paralysis (Ex)—Those hit by a ghoul’s bite or claw attack must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC 14) or be paralyzed for 1d6+2 minutes. Elves are immune to this paralysis;  Create Spawn (Su)—In most cases, ghouls devour those they kill. From time to time, however, the bodies of their humanoid victims lie where they fell, to rise as ghouls themselves in 1d4 days. Casting  protection from evil on a body before the end of that time averts the transformation.\nSQ: Undead—Immune to mind-influencing effects, poison, sleep, paralysis, stunning, and disease. Not subject to critical hits, subdual damage, ability damage, energy drain, or death from massive damage; Turn Resistance (Ex)—+2.\n\nA paralyzed individual is 40% likely to then be eaten by the attacking ghoul, inflicting 7 points of damage per round. Otherwise, the ghoul will enter a new melee. If no new melee opponents are available it will eat the victim on the spot. The ghouls haveno individual treasure.\n\nGhast: CR 3; Medium-Size Undead; HD 4d12; hp 31; Init +2 (Dex); Spd 30 ft.; AC 16 (+2 Dex, +4 natural); Atk +4 melee (1d8+1 and paralysis, bite) and +1 melee (1d4 and paralysis [x2],2 claws); SA stench, paralysis, create spawn; SQ undead, +2 turn resistance; AL CE; SV Fort +1, Ref +3, Will +6; Str 13, Dex 15, Con —, Int 13, Wis 14, Cha 16.\n\nSkills and Feats: Climb +6, Escape Artist +8, Hide +8, Intuit Direction +3, Jump +6, Listen +8, Move Silently +7, Search +6, Spot +8; Multiattack, Weapon Finesse (bite).\nSA: Stench (Ex)—The stink of death and corruption surrounding these creatures is sickening. Those within 10 ft. must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC 15) or be wracked with nausea, suffering a –2 circumstance penalty on all attacks, saves, and skill checks for 1d4+4 minutes; Paralysis (Ex)—Those hit by a ghast’s bite or claw attack must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC 15) or be paralyzed for 1d6+4 minutes. Even elves are vulnerable to this paralysis; Create Spawn (Su)—In most cases, ghasts devour those they kill. From time to time, however, the bodies of their humanoid victims lie where they fell, to rise as ghasts themselves in 1d4 days. Castingprotection from evil on a body before the end of that time averts the transformation.\nSQ: Undead—Immune to mind-influencing effects, poison, sleep, paralysis, stunning, and disease. Not subject to critical hits, subdual damage, ability damage, energy drain, or death from massive damage; Turn Resistance (Ex)—+2.\nPossessions:Three darts +1.\n\nThe ghast will also eat its victims, but it is only 20% likely to do so if other opponents are still present.\n\nThe room itself has no furniture but the undead guard a pile of treasure taken from previous victims. This pile includes 107 gp, 83 ep, a suit of half-plate armor tailored to a dwarf, a small steel shield, a  large steel shield +1, and apotion of clairaudience/ clairvoyance.\n\nAB, AC, AD. THE CELLS\n\nThese are old cells (AB and AC) and a guardroom (AD). There is nothing of value in any of them, just old and rotting furniture. The doors are unlocked and are 50% likely to be ajar.\n\nAE. STORAGE CHAMBER.\n\nThis area was used for storage of furniture. A number of pieces are still piled up and some are valuable if repaired and cleaned. Once refurbished, they might fetch up to 300 gp in a town market.\n\nAF, AG. THE WRAITH LAIR.\n\nThese rooms are used by the wraith (see above-ground ruin for stats). It is here during the day 100% of the time. It might attack a group of up to four individuals immediately, but will wait for an opportunity to surprise a group of 5 or more. Room AF is a small den. It contains a desk, a book case with 40 books, a chair, and a brazier. None of these are very valuable. Room AG is a bedroom.  It once had excellent furnishings but they have long since rotted away. A heavy dampness hangs over the room. The wraith likes to hide under the bed to surprise people. If reduced to 10 or fewer hit points it will flee this area.\n\nAH. THE TEMPLE.\n\nThe wraith knows of this room but does not enter it. It is the remains of an old temple. The altar is in the center of the south wall. Any who come within 10 feet of the huge stone statue on the altar (8 feet tall, carved to resemble a fire giant) will cause the statue to animate. The animation is actually a shadow conjuration at caster level 7 of the giant throwing his hammer at a party member. If the illusion is believed, the target will always be hit for 3–18 points of damage and the hammer will return to the statue. It will be thrown over and over again. Characters can break the statue and the illusion (AC 4; hardness 8; 30 hp; DC 30 to break, blunt weapons only). All other forms of attack are useless except those that guard the mind. Those who interact with the illusion gain a Will save to only take 1/5 damage.\n\nBeneath the statue is a chalice that will turn created  water into holy water once a day. The process requires an hour of game time. Enough holy water will be created to fill one vial. If not sealed in a vial or other airtight container the holy water will evaporate in 4 hours. Caster Level: 3rd; Prerequisites:Craft Wondrous Item, bless water; Market Price: 1500 gp.\n\nThere is a flight of stairs to the dungeon below (detailed below).\n\nAI. PASSAGE.\n\nThis passageway is occasionally occupied by the wraith (10% chance) at night only. Undead might also pass through the corridor.\n\nAJ. THE ROUND ROOM.\n\nThis round room has no furnishings of any type. Undead might pass through, but not actually occupy it. There is a flight of stairs to the dungeon (detailed below).\n\nKEY TO THE DUNGEON LEVEL\n\nThe basement dungeon has some characteristics common to its various rooms. Almost every room is damp and clammy (these four are not: BO, BE, BJ, BK, and will be explained separately), the walls glisten and are moist to the touch. The air is stagnant and foul. Noises are very common (check each turn on a d6, with a 1 or 2 indicating some noise). Use a d10 to determine the source.\n\n1–2\tScurrying or scuttling noise, usually very faint (cause: 1–4 brown rats. They have 1 hp and have no effective attack. Rat holes are very common in the complex except in the four rooms previously noted).\n3–4\tWhistling, very low (cause: air movement).\n5–7\tMoaning, followed by insane laughter and jingling. lasting two rounds (cause: a permanent ghost sound spell has been cast in rooms BN  and BD where the noises are loudest. Dispel magic (DC 22) can remove the noise).\n8–9\tSqueaking (cause: 1–4 brown rats as above, but one rat is 40% likely to be a dire rat (AC 7. MV 15\", HD 1-4 hp, hp: 4, #AT 1, D 1-3 plus 5% chance of disease, save vs. Poison allowed). If a dire rat is present there is a 60% chance for 2-8 more brown rats that will all scurry to the attack. The brown rats are harmless but will mask the dire rat, which is also brown).\n10\tLoud whistle followed immediately by a very strong gust of wind. Unprotected flames are 90% likely to be blown out. (Cause: a permanent gust of wind  spell has been cast in room BNand BD. Dispel magic (DC 22) can remove the wind.\n\nIt should be noted that this area is plagued by drafts. It is basically airtight, so when doors are opened, changing the air pressure, other open doors (if any) are 90% likely to slam shut. Spiked doors are 40% likely to have their spikes shaken loose by the door movement and then slam shut. Every door opened will cause an air current to come up and thus Copening doors a crack” is difficult (DC 19).\n\nBA. TUNNEL.\n\nThis location can be entered from the locked, iron-bound door. It has a padlock holding a bar in place on the inside, thus there is no lock to pick from the ladder side. The ladder to/from location C above is also a possible entrance. This ladder is 40 feet long. Its rungs are old and rotting. For each 10 feet climbed, there is a 10% cumulative chance per person of the rungs giving way and toppling that individual to the floor. Any person on the ladder below the falling individual will also be knocked off unless a save is made (rolling one_’s dexterity or less on a d20). Damage taken will be 1–6 points per each 10 feet of distance fallen. Any fall doing 8 points or more of damage to a character necessitates all items carried making Reflex save (DC 15).\n\nNote that the corner of this tunnel has begun to collapse. It is safe for the moment, however. When the door is opened begin rolling for Cnoises,” as given above.\n\nBB. CAVERN.\n\nThis natural cavern has virtually no ornamentation. The glistening walls reflect light so that any light source is doubled in intensity. The entrance to BC  is only a two and a half-foot crawlway. Room BB is about 12 feet in height.\n\nBC. GREY OOZE CAVE.\n\nThe entranceway is eight feet long but only two and a half feet high. Only gnomes or halflings can scuttle through by merely bending low; other character types must go on all fours. Just over the doorway is a medium-size gray ooze.\n\nGray ooze: CR 4; Medium-Size Ooze; HD 3d10+10; hp 32; Init –5 (Dex); Spd 10 ft.; AC 5 (–5 Dex); Atk +3 melee (1d6+1 and 1d6 acid, slam); SA improved grab, acid, corrosion, constrict 1d6+1 and 1d6 acid; SQ blindsight, cold and fire immunity, ooze, camouflage; AL N; SV Fort +1, Ref –4, Will –4; Str 12, Dex 1, Con 11, Int —, Wis 1, Cha 1.\n\nSA: Improved Grab (Ex)—To use this ability, the gray ooze must hit with its slam attack. If it gets a hold, it can constrict; Acid (Ex)—A gray ooze secretes a digestive acid that quickly dissolves organic material and metal. Any melee hit deals acid damage. The ooze’s acidic touch deals 40 points of damage per round to wood and metal objects. Armor or clothing dissolves and becomes useless  immediately unless it succeeds at a Reflex save (DC 19). The acid cannot harm stone. A metal or wooden weapon that strikes a gray ooze also dissolves immediately unless it succeeds at a Reflex save (DC 19); Constrict (Ex)—A gray ooze deals automatic slam and acid damage with a successful grapple check. The opponent’s clothing and armor suffer a –4 penalty to Reflex saves against the acid; Camouflage (Ex)—It takes a successful Spot check (DC 15) to recognize a motionless gray ooze for what it really is.\nSQ: Blindsight (Ex)—An ooze’s entire body is a primitive sensory organ that can ascertain prey by scent and vibration within 60 ft; Ooze—Immune to mind-influencing effects, poison, sleep, paralysis, stunning, and polymorphing. Not subject to critical hits.\n\nIt will drop on the first individual to enter the room.\n\nOn the far side of the room, visible from the tunnel entranceway, is a staff leaning against the wall. It can be noted that the top is carved and the bottom shod, but at that distance details of the carving cannot be seen.\n\nClose inspection of the staff will show a finely-carved dragon head. It is the head of a blue dragon, but since all paint is eaten away the color is not obvious and the players, unless they have previously encountered blue dragons, will not be able to recognize the exact species. The staff has 11 charges and can be commanded by the proper spell word(s) to perform the following functions:\n\n1.\tDancing lights,  as per the spell as cast by a 1st-level sorceror, except the following. Duration: concentration, but any act will break concentration, even speaking. Cost: 1 charge.\n2.\tLight, as per the spell as cast by a 3rd-level sorceror. The staff is the center of the 20 ft. radius globe (remember it will be very brightin these moist caves). The light will wink out at the end of 3 turns but it will fade in the last round so it can be commanded to light again if that is desired. The holder can extinguish it by a simple command. Cost: 1 charge.\n3.\tSpark,  a 30 ft. long straight discharge can be fired. It does 2d10 points of damage without a save to those wearing metal, 2d4 points to those making their save. The size of the metal item worn/carried must be that of a helm, shield, longsword, etc. Rings and bracers are not large enough. Casting time: 1 action. Cost: 1 charge.\n4.\tLightning bolt,  as per the spell as cast by a 5th-level sorceror. The bolt cannot be 10 ft. wide. It is 5 feet wide and thus will often hit only one opponent. Cost: 2 charges.\nCaster Level:12th; Prerequisites: Craft Staff, dancing lights, light, lightning bolt; Market Price: 54,000 gp.\n\nThe nature of the staff must be discovered by use or the spell identify. Once any identify  is attempted no further information from spells can be obtained, including a charges-left approximation.\n\nBD. THE STATUE ROOM.\n\nThe room is occupied by a stone guardian (see the New Creatures section at the end of this module). It will activate and attack anyone entering from either passage.\n\nStone Guardian:  CR 3; Medium-Size Construct; HD 3d10; hp 20; Init +0; Spd 30 ft.; AC 18 (+8 natural); Atk +3 melee (1d8+1 [x2], 2 slams); SQ construct, immunities, fire resistance 10, cold resistance 10, electricity resistance 10, see invisibility; AL N; SV Fort +0, Ref+1, Will +1; Str 13, Dex 10, Con —, Int —, Wis 10, Cha 1.\n\nSQ: Construct—Immune to mind-influencing effects, poison, disease, and similar effects. Not subject to critical hits, subdual damage, ability damage, energy drain, or death from massive damage; Immunities (Ex)—A stone guardian takes only half damage from piercing or slashing weapons. Stone to flesh, transmute rock to mud, or stone shape  spells will kill it instantly with no saving throw; See Invisibility (Sp)—A stone guardian can continuously see invisbility as cast by a 3rd-level sorceror.\n\nThe south exit (to room BE) is very small, only two feet high and about three feet wide due to large amounts of fallen rock that block the opening. The mechanism working the closed portcullis (blocking the west exit) is in room BF.  It can be lifted (DC 25).\n\nIn the northwest alcove behind the guardian is a statue of a woman. She has large wings and holds a greatsword ready to strike. On her head is a simple brass helmet adorned by a large red ruby (value: 3000 gp).\n\nThe statue was once a part of a ransacked good temple and was defiled by the captors in unholy service. The good energy it still possesses is augmented by the positive energy radiated by the servants of good. A good cleric, a paladin, or a good ranger can go to the statue and remove the helm without reprisal. Furthermore, that individual can pray before the statue and gain a contact other plane  spell (caster level 9). Answers will be in the form of short sentences (up to 12 words). Any other character must suffer a swing from the sword. It always hits for 2–40 points of damage. The alcove is protected by an  antimagic field so that no spell can harm the statue (the dungeon’s occupants regard it as a valuable trophy and this is designed to foil intruders). The statue is considered to have an AC of 4, a hardness of 8 and will take 60 hp of damage only from blunt weapons before shattering into useless fragments.\n\nIf the statue is attacked and destroyed the helm will fall to the ground as a pile of brass filings, though the gem will still be intact.\n\nThe helm will grant to a cleric of good alignment, a paladin, or a good aligned ranger the ability see as if affected by a divine true seeing  spell up to three times per day. However, the character suffers a resistance penalty of –3 on all Will saves. Removing the helm negates its power for one full week. Non-paladins/good rangers/good clerics wearing the helm will often see hallucinations, especially inexplicable colored auras around living figures (make a Will save (DC 13) once per hour). The visions are never harmful, but can trick or mislead a wearer. Caster level: 9th; Prerequisites: Craft Wondrous Item, detect good, true seeing; Market Price: 45,000 gp\n\nBE. THE MIRROR ROOM\n\nThe doorway to this small room is so blocked by fallen rubble and dirt that some digging is required for humans or human-sized characters. Smaller races can squeeze through, but only at crawl rate. On the opposite wall is a unique  mirror of opposition (see New Magic Items). (Note that to be affected the person must glance into the mirror and light must be available.).\n\nThe mirror is attached to the wall with sovereign glue. Physically removing the mirror without universal solvent  always breaks it. The mirror is two feet wide and five feet high and is very fragile. If someone does not hold it whenuniversal solvent is used it will fall and break. Furthermore, it cannot be put in a bag of holding or other transport device without shattering. Undead creatures are not drawn into the mirror.\n\nDon’t forget to give the character experience points for defeating him or herself!\n\nBF. THE WINCH ROOM\n\nThe portcullis wheel gives a mechanical advantage of 6:1, so a character’s bend bars  percentage is multiplied by 6 attempting to lift the portcullis gateway. Two persons can cooperate on a wheel, but no more. The large alcove to the north looks Chazy”  if good light is available. The doors out of the room are both ironshod (DC 25). The double door can be hit by two characters at once, the other by a single character only. All doors are locked.\n\nThe Chaziness” is a gelatinous cube, though bright light (alight  spell, or its equivalent) will show a surface across the mouth of the alcove. The gelatinous cube is 10 feet square and takes up a large part of the room.\n\nGelatinous cube: CR 3; Huge ooze; HD 4d10+36; hp 58; Init –5 (Dex); Spd 15 ft.; AC 3 (–2 size, –5 Dex); Atk +1 melee (1d6+4 and 1d6 acid, slam); Face 10 ft. x 10 ft.; Reach 10 ft.; SA engulf, paralysis, acid; SQ blindsight, transparent, electricity immunity, ooze; AL N; SV Fort +5, Ref –4, Will –4; Str 10, Dex 1, Con 19, Int —, Wis 1, Cha 1. Height 10 ft., Width 10 ft., Depth 10 ft, Weight 10,000 lb.\n\nSA: Engulf (Ex)—Although it moves slowly, a gelatinous cube can simply mow down Large or smaller creatures as a standard action. It cannot make a slam attack during a round in which it engulfs. The gelatinous cube merely has to move over the oppnents, affecting as many as  it can cover. Opponents can make opportunity attacks against the cube, but if they do so they are not entitled to a saving throw. Those who do not attempt opportunity attacks must succeed at a Reflex save (DC 13) or be engulfed; on a success, they are pushed back or aside (opponent’s choice) as the cube moves forward. Engulfed creatures are subject to the cube’s paralysis and acid, and are considered to be grappled and trapped within its body; Paralysis (Ex)—Gelatinous cubes secrete an anesthetizing slime. A target hit by a cube’s melee or engulf attack must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC 16) or be paralyzed for 3d6 rounds. The cube can automatically engulf a paralyzed opponent; Acid (Ex)—A gelatinous cube’s acid does not harm metal or stone.\nSQ: Blindsight (Ex)—An ooze’s entire body is a primitive sensory organ that can ascertain prey by scent and vibration within 60 ft; Transparent (Ex)—Gelatinous cubes are hard to see, even under ideal conditions, and it takes a successful Spot check (DC 15) to notice one. Creatures who fail to notice a cube and walk into it are automatically engulfed; Ooze—Immune to mind-influencing effects, poison, sleep, paralysis, stunning, and polymorphing. Not subject to critical hits.\n\nInside the cube are two gems (value: 450 gp and 650 gp) plus a special crystal hypnosis ball and a large steel shield +2. The crystal ball, if stared into, will contact the wraith (room AG or BE) if it is still in the area. If the contact is established. the wraith can place a suggestion spell with no saving throw applicable. No further contact will occur.\n\nBG. THE SPECTATORS’ ROOM.\n\nThis room is guarded by relativesof the eye tyrant (beholder), the spectators. (See the full description at the end of this module.) Three of the hovering orbs with central eyes an four eye stalks appear in the room. Two of the spectators are 4«  in diameter and one is only the size of a baseball. The two adults (AC body, 4, central eye, 7, MV 10\", HD 4 + 4, hp 28,20 #AT 1, D 2-5, plus magic rays) have full powers, while the infant (hp 1) has no abilities, and will teleport to Nirvana if its parents are killed.\n\nAdult spectators (2): CR 3; Large Outsider (Lawful); HD 4d8+4; hp 28, 20; Init +1 (Dex); Spd 5 ft., fly 25 ft. (good); AC 16 (–1 size, +1 Dex, +6 natural); Atk +4 ranged touch (eye rays), and –2 melee (1d6, bite); SA eye rays; SQ all-around vision, reflection, fly, SR 12; AL LN; SV Fort +5, Ref +5, Will +5; Str 10, Dex 12, Con 13, Int 14, Wis 13, Cha 13. Diameter 4 ft.\n\nSkills and Feats:Diplomacy +10, Hide +2, Knowledge (planes) +9, Listen +10, Sense Motive +8, Spot +10; Alertness, Flyby Attack.\nSA: Eye Rays (Su)—Create Food and Water; Inflict Moderate Wounds; Hold Monster (extended); Telepathy.\nSQ: Reflection (Su)—When the central eye is undamaged, it can reflect one spell per round fired at it and turn the spell back to the caster, as the spell turning  spell. The central eye can only reflect one spell per round. The reflection only occurs if the spectator makes a successful saving throw (regardless of the spell cast at it). Because of this power and its spell resistance a spectator gains no other saving  throws vs. magic. Reflection is possible only if the spell caster is in a 60¡ arc of the central eye; All-Around Vision (Ex)—Spectators are extremely alert, due to their nature. Their many eyes give them a +4 racial bonus to Spot and Search checks, and they can’t be flanked; Flight (Ex)—A spectator’s body is naturally buoyant. This buoyancy allows it to fly as the spell, as a free action, at a speed of 25 ft. This buoyancy also grants it a permanent feather fall  effect with personal range. They will drift aimlessly when asleep, (20% likely when encountered), never touching the ground.\n\nThe spectators are guarding a libram of gainful conjuration. However, they have other treasure not a part of their charge. These additional things can be taken by any amiable party which doesn’t attack first and ask questions later. These items are as follows: 5 pp, 22 gp, 17 ep, 22 sp, and a longsword +1  (Int 12, Wis 12, Cha 12; empathic; detect magic at will, detect chaos at will; AL LN; Ego 6). There is also a scroll of two spells:commune and cure critical wounds (caster level 12).\n\nBH. THE CORRIDOR.\n\nBoth doors into this corridor are locked and iron-reinforced (as per room BF). A large section of the corridor has begun to crumble. This is not dangerous. Note the secret door to the complex of rooms below. The door is very well made. so that casual observation cannot find it. The standard chances to locate secret doors apply ifa search is conducted.\n\nBI, BJ, BK. THE WRAITH LAIR.\n\nThese rooms form the inner sanctum of the wraith. All three rooms have a very minor Negative Plane existence due to his strong ties to this plane. In life, he was a strong and dreaded warlord, a man of cruel cunning and great evil, who mocked the paths of goodness and light, preferring instead the wicked and the dark. At the height of his powers he struck a bargain with a powerful devil, who granted him after death a continued existence in wraith form in exchange for service in life. There are special properties built into these chambers, bestowed as a mark of Infernal Favor:\n\nWhile in these rooms the wraith gains the special quality Fast Healing 1. Thus, if confronted earlier in the adventure he will return here to be healed.\n\nProtection from evil, bless, prayer,and doom will not function in these rooms.\n\nAs an individual descends the stairs he or she will feel a tingling all over the body, regardless of alignment. Those wearing metal of any type will see a mild blue glow appear. Invisible creatures are affected by the metal coloring, though the item and person remain invisible. The area virtually exudes evil and has a moderate aura of evil. The rooms themselves are not exceptional in any way. If the wraith is here (80% chance if he has not yet been encountered, 100% chance if he already has) he will be inBI 30% of the time, BJ 20%, and BK 50%. If he is not present at all, he will be summoned when the first living creature enters room BK. He will then appear on the stairs.\n\nThe wraith can also summon any surviving skeletons, zombies, and the skelter and zombire that remain in the ruin to come to his aid. They will mass at the door from BN.  As they will come at their normal movement speed they might not arrive for several rounds. Naturally, if these creatures have all been destroyed none will come. Someone must open the door, or it must be unlocked/opened/broken for them to come and help. If  the door is closed they will be massed for the attack at the door to BN. The zombire will try to hold the door open if it can.\n\nRooms BEand BJ are empty of any items. Room BK contains the wraith’s treasure. This consists of the following:\n\n37 pp, 235 gp, 402 ep, 670 sp, 8720 cp\nA necklace of black pearls worth 4000 gp\nA battleaxe +2\nA small wooden shield +3\n\nA ring of elemental command (Air).  To be activated, a 7 HD monster from the Elemental Plane of Air must be killed by the wearer. An 8 HD monster that breathes Fire, Lightning, or can turn to stone will also activate it. If others help in the killing the ring will only activate if the wearer did at least half of the damage to the monster. Until activated, the ring will seem to be a normal ring of invisibility.\n\nBL, BM, BN, and BO. THE LAIR OF UNDEAD.\n\nA small band of zombies, skeletons, the skelter and zombire exist here (the zombies and skeletons are separate from the roster given previously). The statistics for the skelter and zombire have already been given. Those for the skeletons and zombies are as  follows:\n\nSkeletons (8): CR 1/3; Medium-Size Undead; HD 1d12; hp 10, 10, 9, 9, 8, 8, 8, 8; Init +5 (+1 Dex, +4 Improved Initiative); Spd 30 ft.; AC 13 (+1 Dex, +2 natural); Atk +0 melee (1d4 [x2], 2 claws); SQ undead, immunities; AL N; SV Fort +0, Ref +1, Will +2; Str 10, Dex 12, Con —, Int —, Wis 10, Cha 1.\n\nFeats: Improved Initiative.\n\nZombies (6): CR 1/2; Medium-Size Undead; HD 2d12+3; hp 21, 21, 21, 20, 20, 20; Init –1 (Dex); Spd 30 ft.; AC 11 (–1 Dex, +2 natural); Atk +2 melee (1d6+1, slam); SQ Undead, partial actions only; AL N; SV Fort +0, Ref –1, Will +3; Str 13, Dex 8, Con —, Int —, Wis 10, Cha 1.\n\nFeats: Toughness.\n\nThe location of these monsters is: BL: two skeletons and one zombie; BM: three skeletons, one zombie, and the skelter; BN:  one skeleton and two zombies; BO:two skeletons, two zombies, and the zombire. Each group of creatures will rush to the attack. They will reinforce each other if separated within 1–3 rounds.\n\nThe rooms themselves contain no treasure or other items. They are very cold, however (–15¡  F). Persons in this area for more than 10 minutes must make Fortitude saves or suffer 1d6 points of subdual cold damage, as outlined in the DMG, pages 86–87. The door to the corridor leading to room AJ is unlocked.\n\nBP. THE MYSTERY LIGHT.\n\nWhen this door is unlocked, opened by knock  or broken, there will be no rush of air between the rooms. Instead, a soft light will grow in intensity until it equals full daylight radiance. Undead will not enter the room. Upon crossing the threshold the temperature will increase dramatically to 65¡ F. and the air will be fresh and slightly scented of orange blossoms. Immediately characters must make a Will save (DC 18) from a powerful charm person  spell. The characters who fail their saving throw will go to the door to BO, open it, and walk right in. The charmed characters will say nothing at all performing only that action. Room BP  itself contains no items at all. The walls are dry. The charming effect occurs only when the threshold is crossed. Those who are not charmed will shiver as the spell rebounds from them, but will have no recollection of what has just occurred. Nor will they recall where the charmed characters have gone.\n\nBO. THE STUDY.\n\nThis room contains four items of interest. There is a large rolltop desk with six drawers, ten pigeon-holes, and ample writing equipment and ink; a large bed with down pillows; a large easy chair next to a rack of 100 books; and a skeleton chained to the back wall. The skeleton is animated but incapable of breaking its bonds.\n\nA charmed character entering from room BP will either begin writing, lie down and go to sleep, or sit down and begin reading. He or she will show no desire whatsoever to leave the room and will fight to stay there. Dispel magic might break the charm (DC 26) if thrown from within the room. It will have no effect if thrown into the room from BP.  In fact, no spell whatsoever can cross between the two rooms, as there is a special antimagic screen in the doorway. Passing through the screen will not negate the charm, nor will any cursed or magic item be negated. A spell caster standing in the doorway  will temporarily be prevented from casting spells but cursed items can not be removed!\n\nIn the bottom drawer of the desk is a silver pitcher, platter, and mug. These items are manipulated by unseen servants  kept in this room by the antimagic screen. They have been made powerless to approach within five feet of the chained skeleton. Upon command, the pitcher will fill with water (ice cold), herbal tea (piping hot), or wine (excellent vintage). Caster Level: 5th;Prerequisites: Craft Wondrous Item,create water; Market Price: 5400 gp. The platter will produce a complete meal of beef, lamb, turkey, or pheasant, along with all the trimmings, for four people upon command.Caster Level: 7th;Prerequisites:  Craft Wondrous Item, 4 ranks of Profession (cook),create food and water; Market Price: 15,000 gp. The mug will produce mead, beer, or ale (each of excellent quality) upon command. Caster Level: 5th; Prerequisites:Craft Wondrous Item, 4 ranks of Professsion (brewer), create water; Market Price: 10,000 gp. The pitcher can fill 3 times a day, the platter once,  and the mug 6 times. Each must be clean and empty to function. A charmed character will not allow the others to remove any items from the room. The books are of no value and contain no useful information.\n\nThe skeleton is the remains of a lawful good 15th level magic-user who once came to this ruin to do baffle with the evil creatures within. His attempt, though valiant, was not successful, and he is now kept here, imprisoned, not wholly alive yet not wholly  dead, and this torture has gnawed at his spirit for centuries. Like the skelter, his skeleton has a tongue and eyes. He also shares the immunities of the skelter but a detect evil  or will show that he is not evil and is, in fact, lawful good. If he is destroyed he will simply reform in 24 hours, even if his bones are powdered.\n\nHe cannot initiate speech but can answer questions if a speak with dead  spell is employed. He will only roll his eyes and move his head to normal speech. He will volunteer no information and his answers will always be very brief. To a proper question he can say that he Cwants release,” Cfreedom,” Cpeace,” etc., that is, he wants to cease his undying state and have eternal peace. This can be done via remove curse or a break enchantment.  If this is done the person casting the spell will receive a limited wish from the magic-user’s deity at once. The person granted the wish  may not consult with anyone, for the statement to name the wish will be placed directly in the recipient’s head via telepathy. The character must respond at once. Note that the magic-user knows nothing of the current ruin conditions and therefore questions along that line are doomed to failure.\n\nRESTENFORD\n\nThe following is a quick reference guide to the town of Restenford and its buildings.

Virtually every able-bodied adult male or boy over 13 is enrolled in the militia. People not in the militia, including young children, have poor morale (–3) and will seldom fight even if backed into a corner. Any such individual, if he or she does overcome initial fright, will grab any weapon at hand. Damage caused by these hand weapons is as follows: pitchfork (farmers only) 1–6, knife 1–3, bottle 1–3 (armored or helmeted persons take only 1 point), broken bottle 1–4 (35% likely to harm wielder if breaking and can be used against non-metal armor or the face if not protected), small hammer 1–3, chair 1–6 (only adults can wield this to any effect and armor can reduce damage by half), and all blunt instruments 1–3.\n\nRestenford is meant to be a safe harbor and/or base of operations for a party. This does not mean that adventure there is impossible; far from it. However, as DM you should try to make this purpose clear without having to blurt it out in as many words. The  details of the castle and abbey are given but the exact information therein, and the map of the castle, are not likely to be necessary until AD&Dª Module L2.\n\nThe garrison is provided to maintain some degree of order through the town, as you will note the town is mostly chaotic neutral in nature. Chaotic neutral does not equate with brawling, meleeing, spells in the streets, and open mayhem. Be sure you are clear on the meaning of this alignment and that your players understand it as well. In many of the locations in town there will be a chance topick up information, thus you will have to know what the non-player characters know about the town itself. Any character that has information leading to a likely adventure will be outlined hereafter. Minor peasants, farmers, shopkeepers, fishermen, and children will almost never have any information of real value. They will know who lives next to them, of course, but they will never know about magic items, level, or even true alignment.\n\nWhen a piece of information is given it must be obtained by conversation, bribing, etc. The NPC will not just offer information to strangers! A party can, at any time, just wander out into the countryside. This can be disastrous if they are under-equipped, undermanned, or if they are too low in level.\n\nENCOUNTER KEY—TOWN OF RESTENFORD\n\n1.\tThe Garrison/Castle\n\nThe following is a roster of all persons who live in the castle.

The guards also use a d8+6 for their characteristics should these need to be determined (those with exceptional abilities have already been noted in the text). Andrella and Fairwind’s statistics will be given in module L2.\n\nKey to the Castle\n\nDM Note: Play is not likely to be conducted in the castle during this module but is very likely if module L2  is also used. Naturally, you might wish to use this castle for some other adventure and not as part of this series.\n\nGarrison Location Chart\n\nEach room number or name is given below. At each time of the day listed the percentage chances for the given persons being in that spot are provided. Obviously circumstances can alter the locations.

The machinery to operate these arein the two gate houses: one operates the drawbridge and the other the portcullis. Note the walkway around the entire stone wall. The wall is 20 feet high and is embrasured. The walkway is wooden and narrow, and is 16 feet above the ground. The walkway canbe reached from either a gate tower, Pelltar’s tower (8),  or the four ladders shown from the courtyard. There is a ladder in each gate tower, leading to the walkway and also to the top of the tower. The doors into the tower, both at ground level and at the walkway, are neither barred nor locked.\n\n2.\tTHE BARN\n\nThe barn stables 13 horses, while the stablehands live in a small back room. These horses are all light warhorses\n\nLight warhorses (13): CR 1; Large Animal; HD 3d8+9; hp 29, 28, 27, 27, 26, 26, 24, 23, 23, 22, 22, 22; Init +1 (Dex); Spd 60 ft.; AC 14 (–1 size, +1 Dex, +4 natural); Atk +4 melee (1d4+3 [x2], 2 hooves), and –1 melee (1d3+1, bite); Face 5 ft. by 10 ft.; SQ scent; AL N; SV Fort +6, Ref +4, Will +2; Str 16, Dex 13, Con 17, Int 2, Wis 13, Cha 6.\n\nSkills: Listen +7, Spot +7.\nSQ: Scent (Ex).\n\nEach has a suit of leather barding in the back room. The Baron-Champion’s horse is also stabled here. It is a heavy warhorse.\n\nHeavy warhorse: CR 2; Large Animal; HD 4d8+12; hp 35; Init +1 (Dex); Spd 50 ft.; AC 14 (–1 size, +1 Dex, +4 natural); Atk +6 melee (1d6+4 [x2], 2 hooves), and +1 melee (1d4+2, bite); Face 5 ft. by 10 ft.; SQ scent; AL N; SV Fort +7, Ref +5, Will +2; Str 18, Dex 13, Con 17, Int 2, Wis 13, Cha 6.\n\nSkills: Listen +7, Spot +7.\nSQ: Scent (Ex).\n\nA suit of chainmail barding is kept in the castle. The gear belonging to this horse includes a medallion and harness that fits around the horse’s forehead. This medallion of animal wakefulness gives the horse a +4 luck bonus to saving throws against sleep spells when worn. The medallion will not grant this resistance to an intelligent creature. Caster Level: 4th; Prerequisites: Craft Wondrous Item, sleep; Market Value: 3000 gp.\n\n3.–6.\tGUARDHOUSE\n\nThese rooms comprise the guardhouse complex. Room 3 is a combination dining room/kitchen. Room 4 is a barracks for the veterans. Room 5 is a barracks for the 1st-level warriors. Room 6  is a cell for temporary detention (see cells in the lower level of the castle). The scullions, butlers, and chief guards (Gelpas and Relkin) stay in the castle.\n\n7a, 7b. GARDENS\n\nThese are the two gardens maintained by the Baron’s wife and the scullions. Garden 7a produces foodstuffs and spices while 7b  is for flowers. The trees along the guardhouse are cherry trees.\n\n8.\tPELLTAR’S TOWER\n\nThis is the tower of Pelltar the Wizard (see building 21). Pelltar’s statistics, items, spells, etc. are described under the location 21  listing. Pelltar has a deed to the tower and an agreement of entry even if the Baron were to die. The doors (at the top of the tower, walkway level, and ground level) are all arcane locked  (caster level 9) and have complex locks (DC 30 to pick, DC 35 to break). The trap door from the top of the tower hasexplosive runes on it. The ground level of the tower is 8a,the walkway level 8b, and the top of the tower, 8c.\n\n8a: Just inside the doorway is a magic mouth that will yell if anyone but a tall bearded man enters. The door is also fire trapped (caster level 9). The room’s guardians are four skeletons animated by Pelltar to guard the room.\n\nSkeletons (4):  CR 1/3; Medium-Size Undead; HD 1d12; hp 10, 10, 9, 7; Init +5 (+1 Dex, +4 Improved Initiative); Spd 30 ft.; AC 13 (+1 Dex, +2 natural); Atk +0 melee (1d4 [x2], 2 claws); SQ undead, immunities; AL N; SV Fort +0, Ref +1, Will +2; Str 10, Dex 12, Con—, Int —, Wis 10, Cha 1.\n\nFeats: Improved Initiative.\n\nThey will not attack anyone in the company of Pelltar. The room contains some minor stores of food and water (enough for one person for about one week). There is a stone staircase to the next level.\n\n8b: The walkway door is fire trapped (caster level 9) and another magic mouth is in place as in 8a. This room is Pelltar’s make-shift bedroom. He rarely sleeps here. There is a stone staircase to the next level.\n\n8c: The trapdoor from above is iron reinforced and barred 50% of the time (DC 25 to break). The trapdoor down to level b is made of iron and is arcane locked (DC 38 to break). If it is opened for more than 10 seconds it will cause a trap to activate. One person moving rapidly can easily get through before the trap is sprung. A second person must make a successful Dex check (DC 8), a third must make a successful Dex check (DC 10), a fourth must make a successful Dex check (DC 13), and a fifth person will not succeed at all. On the 10th second the trapdoor is open a slab of iron will fall down over the doorway, inflicting 3–30 points of damage to anyone caught in the trap. In addition, a weak character will be unable to move the slab to gain entry. Inside the room is Pelltar’s lab. It contains a duplicate magic-user’s book (see location 21 for spells) hidden in a secret panel of the ceiling (helevitates with his boots to get it). Note that an elf cannot see the secret door in mere torchlight or its equivalent. A light spell, or actually being on the ceiling, is required to spot it. Also here is a crystal ball of clairaudience resting on a small pedestal. The ball is trapped so that if it is removed a packet ofdust of sneezing and choking  (Primary damage: 2d6 temporary Con (Fortitude save, DC 15), secondary damage: 1d6 temporary Con (Fortitude save, DC 15)) will explode in a 10-foot radius. A thief might detect the trap and attempt to remove it in the normal manner with a Search check (DC20) and a Disable Device check (DC 25). Beneath the packet, under a secret compartment, are four large rubies valued at 800, 900, 1200, and 1500 gp.\n\n9.\tOUTER HALL\n\nThe outer hall has two chairs, a table, and a mirror, all of which are perfectly ordinary.\n\n10.\tDINING ROOM\n\nThe dining table in this room is large enough to accommodate 12 people. The silverware is kept here in aarcane locked  (caster level 13) cabinet lined with iron. An attempt to break into it by physical force requires a Strength check (DC 28). However, the simple command word Crelease\" will cause it to open. A silver service is inside, valued at 1300 gp and weighing 1450 gp.\n\n11.\tTHRONE ROOM\n\nThe throne room is dominated by a broad dais of three short steps. On the top are two carved chairs for the Baron and Baroness. On the next step are two more chairs, the one on the right for the Baronette and the left chair for the Sorcerer. On the loweststep are two more chairs, the right for the druid from location 35 and the left for the abbot from location 16. Anyone on the dais can order a shield  spell to spring up between the dais and the rest of the room for as long as one or more individuals are seated on the dais. There are benches along both walls for members of the court.\n\n12.\tTHE KITCHEN\n\nThis is an ordinary kitchen and is not unusual in any way.\n\n13.\tPANTRY\n\nThis is a large pantry, and includes fresh and preserved foods, spices, beer, wine, ale, and mead. The stores in this room have a value of over 200 gp.\n\n14.\tGUARD POST\n\nThis is a small guard station containing a table and four chairs. There is a weapon rack containing two longbows, two longspears, a trident, and two halberds. Two baskets of arrows, 20 in each, are in the corner near the bows. A heavy crossbow with a pouch of 5 bolts hangs on the wall\n\n15.\tGELPAS’ ROOM\n\nThis is the private quarters of Gelpas, Captain of the Guard. The furnishings are of good quality. He has seven brass statues of armored figures in various places around the room. These one foot tall statues have an art value of 30 gp each. They weigh 15 pounds each. A chest, an upright wardrobe, a large bed, table and three chairs completes the room. Gelpas’ wife also lives here and most of the clothing is hers.\n\n16.\tRELKIN’S ROOM\n\nThis is Relkin’s private quarters. The room is sparsely furnished but the bed, chest, wardrobe, and table with chair are of good quality. A suit of leather armor is hidden in the false top of his chest. The armor has a +3 armor bonus vs. normal missiles and a +2 armor bonus vs. melee attacks. Its gp value is 200. In the pillow of the bed is single gem worth 150 gp.\n\n17, 18. GUEST ROOMS\n\nThese rooms are for visitors and guests. They each contain the following: a large double bed, a table, and four chairs, a four-drawer chest, a footlocker type chest (under the bed), a mirror on the wall (2 ft. x 3 ft.), and a large flambeau for three candles, made of silver and valued at 85 gp.\n\n19a, 19b. SCULLIONS’ ROOMS\n\nThese are the quarters for the scullery servants. The sleeping arrangements are: room a is for Kelso and George, and room b for Bettie and her husband Amos (the guard). Marie is married to Gelpas and stays in his room. The furnishings in each are a large double bed, two two-drawer dressers, a table, and two chairs. Kelso and George have 4 gp and 27 sp, respectively, in their dressers. Bettie has saved 31 gp from her and Amos’ wages.\n\n20a, b, c. SERVANTS’ ROOMS\n\nThese are the private quarters of the family servants. Neither Andrella nor Fairwind have any ladies-in-waiting. If they did, these servants would live in 20a, and 20b. Andrella would like to have a personal maid or two, but her mother will not hear of it. Room 20a and 20b  houses the two butlers. There are two single beds, two chests of drawers (three drawers each), and a table with two chairs. Hidden in the room are 47 gp and 31 ep\n\n21a. ANDRELLA’S BEDROOM\nThis is the private quarters of Andrella. It is quite lavish appointed and decorated. It has a small ivory statue of a woman picking flowers, valued at 150 gp, a silver candlestick valued at 100 gp, a painting of a woodland scene valued at 120 gp, a set of silver combs and brushes valued at 250 gp. The bed is covered in silk. Additional silk bed clothes, valued at 120 gp, are in the bottom drawer of a six-drawer dresser. Her wardrobe has many gowns of value (there are 20, each  worth 3–18 gp, total value 170 gp). In a false bottom of the top drawer is a silver and jade necklace valued at 800 gp with matching earrings valued at 100 gp. Lesser items of jewelry, valued at 100 gp total can be found in the third drawer. Her spell book (see area 1. The Baron & his Family, for spell list) is in a small secret chamber in the floor beneath a wall-to-wall rug.\n\n21b. SITTING ROOM \n\nThis is Andrella’s sitting room. Furnishings in this room are two large divans, a padded loveseat, and a large padded chair. A very large mirror with an elaborate frame (value: 300 gp) is hung on the wall. Its size is 3 1/2 ft. x 4 1/2 ft.\n\n22a. FAIRWIND’S BEDROOM\n\nThis is the private quarters of Fairwind. The furnishings are expensive and tasteful.

WAITING ROOM\n\nThis is Fairwind’s waiting room. Two divans, two padded chairs, and a large table are in this chamber. On a wall is a mural of the castle.\n\n23.  BARON’S PRIVATE OUARTERS\n\nThis three room complex is the quarters of Baron Grellus. Note the secret doors between 21a and 22a, and between 22a and 23. The entire family knows about them.\n\n23a. BEDROOM\n\nThis is the Baron’s bedroom. It has a large bed, a chest of four drawers, a footlocker, a table and four chairs, a wardrobe, and a portrait of a battle scene. These items are of good quality but not very expensive. On the wall is a light crossbow and a quiver of six bolts, plus a pair of crossed daggers (balanced for throwing). The Baron is fully trained in both weapons.\n\n23b. STUDY\n\nThis is the Baron’s private study. His wife and he know of the secret door to the chambers below but Andrella does not. The secret door is covered by a carpet.\n\nThe room contains two large padded chairs, a writing desk, a table and two chairs, a liquor cabinet (contains 6 opened bottles and 6 unopened bottles; the unopened bottles are worth 16 gp, 14 gp, 12 gp, 8 gp, 7 gp, and 4 gp), and a book shelf containing 500 books. The books contain no magic or important information. However, many are valuable because of their high quality craftsmanship. The collection is valued at 1200 gp, with 1000 gp of that total belonging to 40 of the books.\n\n23c. SITTING ROOM\n\nThis is a waiting room. Six chairs are standing around a hexagonal table covered with red felt. Two padded chairs are also present, plus a side cabinet holding four bottles of opened liquors and three decks of ordinary playing cards.\n\nTHE LOWER LEVEL-BARON’S CASTLE\n\nDM Note: Only the Baron knows the exact location of the family treasure, and how it is guarded.\n\n1.  THE NORTH CORRIDOR\n\nThe doors in this corridor are all steel and locked (DC 28). The doors are small so that two figures cannot combine their strengths. In front of each cell is a large iron box used to house the prisoner’s goods. Magic items and weapons of any type are kept in Gelpas’ room upstairs. The door to the corridor is trapped to ring a small bell in Gelpas’ room every time it is opened.\n\n2., 3. THE PRISON CELLS\n\nThese are jails. Nothing in eitherroom could be used as an effective battering ram. There are two cots, two chairs, a table, and a large bucket in each cell. The Baron never mistreats prisoners but he will use shackles if necessary, plus binding and gagging.\n\n4. THE EAST CORRIDOR\n\nThis passageway leads to the outside. The trap door outside the castle cannot be opened by anything except a knock  spell or by physical strength. The lock is on the inside and cannot be reached from the outside. The handle on the outside, hidden in soft dirt, is weak and will break before the lock and bar holding the trap door shut break. An axe, hammer, or crowbar (all very noisy devices) must be used if physical strength (DC 25) is used to force the trap door open from the outside. Remember that a single knock will not release both the lock and the bar. From outside, treat the trap door as a concealed door (Search check, DC 18).\n\nThe secret door to the rest of the complex is reinforced by steel rods. There is also a strong spring keeping it firmly closed that canbe overcome by pulling the door away on a successful Str check (DC 18). The spring can be bypassed for 15 seconds only if the trip mechanism is depressed. It is behind a secret door (Search check, DC 20) in a compartment behind the ladder two feet high. The ladder is anchored to the wall of the chimney from the Baron’s room. This means of bypassing the spring will only work once in a 24 hour period, so it must be depressed and the persons wishing to enter the rest of the complex must rush in without delay. In the time allowed, 3–6 prepared characters can run in. The last must make a Dex check (DC 20) to check that the character can jump clear. If caught in the closing door, a character will suffer 6–60 points of damage. A figure caught and losing more than 20 points of damage, regardless of total hit points and even if killed by the trap, will lose a limb to the door. The chances are 60% for an arm, and 40% for a leg.\n\nUnprepared person may miss the trip mechanism altogether. Only one try per person to open the door is allowed, but once accomplished the figure may always do so again when he or she is fully healed. A damaged character must make a second attempt. The Baron has passed the opening test, though Fairwind has not.\n\n5.\tTHE SECRET CORRIDOR\n\nHidden below the floor, behind a secret door at the intersection of the corridors, is aring of protection from stone guardians. The ring  protects the wearer and all persons within a 10« radius. This ring only affects stone guardians in this complex and no others (see the text concerning this new monster). The magic mouth has long since worn off and now the stone guardians attack anyone, including the Baron, not wearing thisring.\n\n6.\tTHE GUARDIAN'S ROOM\n\nJust beyond the door from corridor 5is a stone guardian.\n\nStone Guardian:  CR 3; Medium-Size Construct; HD 3d10; hp 20; Init +0; Spd 30 ft.; AC 18 (+8 natural); Atk +3 melee (1d8+1 [x2], 2 slams); AL N; SQ construct, immunities, fire resistance 10, cold resistance 10, electricity resistance 10, see invisibility; SV Fort +0, Ref +1, Will +1; Str 13, Dex 10, Con —, Int —, Wis 10, Cha 1.\n\nIt will animate and attack anyone not wearing the ring or who is within 10 feet of the person wearing the ring. If the ring  is being worn while the door is opened,i.e. the owner is wearing it as he or she enters this area, the guardian will not even animate and will appear to be nothing more than a statue (though a  detect magic will reveal its magical nature). If the ring is not being worn, it will move toward the party until the ringis  put on. The guardian might also attack a party or character from the rear if the ring bearer passes out into room 7. The protection of the ring is negated forever if the ring wearer, or anyone in the protective aura of the ring, physically attacks the stone guardian (whether it is animated or not!)\n\nThe room itself contains nothing but the guardian.\n\n7.\tTHE TRAP STAIRS\n\nThis room is empty, but the second stair of the staircase leading out is a pressure-activated trap that turns the staircase into a slide.\n\nSlide Trap: CR 1; no attack roll necessary (1d6+1); Reflex save (DC 20) avoids; Search (DC 20); Disable Device (DC 20).\n\nNaturally, stepping over the trigger step avoids springing the trap.\n\n8.\tTHE TREASURE ROOM\n\nThe ceiling in this room is a permanent image  (caster level 20). The ceiling is really 20 feet high but an illusionary ceiling is at the 10 foot mark. Eleven feet up is a loft containing the Baron’s treasure: 1200 gp, 13,650 sp, and 20 gems: 12 x 50 gp, 3 x 100 gp, 3 x 250 gp, 500 gp, and 2000 gp.\n\nIn the real ceiling is a secret door. Behind the door is a small ledge containing a ring of djinni calling. The compartment is lead-lined so that detect magic  will not reveal the ring. The servant of the ring is Balooshi the Djinni.\n\nBalooshi the Djinni: CR 5; Large Outsider (Air, Chaotic, Good); HD 7d8+14; hp 51; Init +8 (+4 Dex, +4 Improved Initiative); Spd 20 ft., fly 60 ft. (perfect); AC 16 (–1 size, +4 Dex, +3 natural); Atk: +10/+5 melee (1d8+6, slam); Reach 10 ft.; SA spell-like abilities, air mastery, whirlwind; SQ plane shift, telepathy, acid immunity; AL CG; SV Fort +7, Ref +9, Will +7; Str 18, Dex 19, Con 14, Int 14, Wis 15, Cha 15.\n\nSkills and Feats:  Appraise +9, Concentration +9, Craft (any one) +11, Escape Artist +11, Knowledge (any one) +9, Listen +9, Move Silently +9, Sense Motive +9, Spellcraft +9, Spot +9; Combat Casting, Combat Reflexes, Dodge, Improved Initiative.\nSA: Spell-Like Abilities (Sp)—invisibilty, create food and water, create wine, major creation, persistant image, permanent image, wind walk, gaseous form; Air Mastery (Ex)—Airborne creatures suffer a –1 circumstance penalty to attack and damage rolls against a djinni; Whirlwind (Su).\nSQ: Plane Shift (Sp)—A genie can enter any of the elemental planes, the Astral Plane, or the Material Plane. This ability transports the genie and up to six other creatures, provided they all link hands with the genie. It is otherwise similar to the spell of the same name; Telepathy (Su)—A genie can communicate telepathically with any creature within 100 ft. that has a language; Acid Immunity (Ex).\n\nBalooshi is a good friend of the Baron and the Baron never abuses the djinni’s powers. He rarely calls upon him to do more than reestablish the permanent illusion of the ceiling in this room. The ring can be used as long as the djinni is alive (to be healed the djinni must go to the Elemental Plane of Air for one day per point of healing required—cures from mortal clerics will not help a djinni). However, it the  ring is used too often the djinni might automatically be released. This chance is 25% if thering  is used twice in one week, 50% if used three times in one week, 75% if used four times in one week, and 100% (he will not come) if it is used a fifth time. Balooshi will not reveal this property of the ring  to a new master unless the master clearly saves the djinni from destruction on the Prime Material Plane.\n\n9.\tTHE CORRIDOR SENTRY\n\nInside this room is a stone guardian.\n\nStone Guardian: CR 3; Medium-Size Construct; HD 3d10; hp 25; Init +0; Spd 30 ft.; AC  18 (+8 natural); Atk +3 melee (1d8+1 [x2], 2 slams); AL N; SQ construct, immunities, fire resistance 10, cold resistance 10, electricity resistance 10, see invisibility; SV Fort +0, Ref +1, Will +1; Str 13, Dex 10, Con —, Int —, Wis 10, Cha 1.\n\nHis actions will be as per the stone guardian in room 6.  There is nothing else in the room. Note that it is very likely that the guardian will animate once the ring-bearer goes down the passage to room 10 if someone is outside the 10 foot protective circle of the ring.\n\n10. THE DESERTED CHAMBER\n\nThis room is completely empty.\n\n11.  THE STONE GUARDIAN\n\nInside this room waits another stone guardian.\n\nStone Guardian:  CR 3; Medium-Size Construct; HD 3d10; hp 25; Init +0; Spd 30 ft.; AC 18 (+8 natural); Atk +3 melee (1d8+1 [x2], 2 slams); AL N; SQ construct, immunities, fire resistance 10, cold resistance 10, electricity resistance 10, see invisibility; SV Fort +0, Ref+1, Will +1; Str 13, Dex 10, Con —, Int —, Wis 10, Cha 1.\n\nIt will react exactly like those in rooms 9 and 6. There is no other item in the room.\n\n12.  THE EMPTY ROOM\n\nThis is an empty room, but on the south wall, 8 feet off the floor, is a pressure-sensitive block that can be depressed (Search check, DC 20). Pressing it down will negate the 24 hour restriction of the spring-locked secret door between rooms 4 and 5for twenty minutes.\n\n13.  THE OBELISK ROOM\n\nAt the end of the corridor is a small obelisk, standing 4 feet high. On the east side is a small secret door (Search check, DC 20). Beyond this secret door is a small compartment containing a special  deck of many things. The deck is enchanted so that it will charm any who see it (DC 17). The charm  causes the character to shuffle the deck and pick a card at once. Once a single card is selected the charm  is broken but if the deck is then put away it will vanish in 10 minutes. Trying to split up the cards will not stop the disappearance.\n\nRESTENFORD\n\nThe buildings specially noted on the reference guide given previously are detailed below.\n\n2.\tFLETCHER\n\nPelo the elf is the town fletcher.\n\nPelo: Male Elf Warrior 2; CR 1; Medium-Size Humanoid (Elf); HD 2d8+2; hp 13; Init +1 (Dex); Spd 30 ft.; AC 14 (+1 Dex, +3 studded leather armor); Atk +3 melee (1d8+3, 19–20/x2, longsword), or +3 ranged (1d8, x3, longbow +1); SQ elven traits; AL CG; SV Fort +3, Ref +1, Will +0; Str 17, Dex 13, Con 12, Int 12, Wis 11, Cha 4.\n\nSkills and Feats: Craft (fletcher) (cc) +3 1/2, Hide (cc) + 2 1/2 (+3 1/2), Jump +7 (+8); Weapon Focus (longbow).\nSQ: Elven Traits (Ex).\nPossessions: 7 arrows +1, longbow +1 with 20 arrows, longsword, studded leather armor.\n\nHe is a trusted member of the town militia.

It will produce one each of the following potions once each week until a total of 18 potions, have been produced (Smyth does not know the number of Ccharges” on the beaker): longevity, polymorph self, and haste.  The beaker is in a locked chest guarded by a set of three spring-activated poison needles in the bottom of the chest.

The wooden box containing the beaker also contains seven small vials of large scorpion venom (Injury DC 18; primary and secondary damage 1d6 temporary Str; Market Value 200 gp each). The vials are necessary since the amount used to coat the needles will deteriorate in two weeks and the needles must be coated again. Smyth is loyal to the town and serves in the militia, but if the going gets tough he will take a potion of polymorph self and flee (he always carries one such potion). Smyth cannot be hired.\n\n12.\tBOWYER\n\nPerk the elf is the town bowyer.\n\nPerk: Male Elf Expert 1/Warrior 1; CR 1; Medium-Size Humanoid (Elf); HD 1d8+1d6; hp 15; Init +1 (Dex); Spd 30 ft.; AC 13 (+1 Dex, +2 leather armor); Atk +3 melee (1d8+2, 19–20/x2, longsword), or +2 ranged (1d8, x3, masterwork longbow); SQ elven traits; AL CN; SV Fort +2, Ref +1, Will +3; Str 14, Dex 12, Con 11, Int 14, Wis 13, Cha 13.\n\nSkills and Feats: Climb +7, Craft (bowyer) (cc) +7, Swim +2 (+7), Wilderness Lore (cc) +6; Weapon Focus (longbow).\nSQ: Elven Traits (Ex).\nPossessions: Leather armor, longsword, masterwork longbow with 20 arrows.\n\nHis bows are of excellent quality and sell for 85 gp a long bow and 30 gp a short bow.

He sells light lunches, beer, ale, mead, and hard liquors. His wine cellar contains poor vintages. Gap is very skilled with his darts. He may challenge patrons to a dart game. A dart game consists of three throws of three darts each. A d20 is rolled for each dart thrown: 12 miss target, 3–10=1 point, 11–16=2 points, 17–19 = 3 points, 20=5 points (bullseye). The person with the highest score wins.  Roll Gap’s dice in secret and add +2 to the result. The tavern bank is 108 gp and 220 ep. Behind the bar can be found 4–16 gp, 2–20 ep, 25+1–50 sp, and 50 + 1–50 cp. Gap does not cheat in any way. Neither of these dwarves is hireable since they make a good living at the tavern.\n\n16., 17. ABBEY OF PHAULKON\n\nThe abbey is devoted to Phaulkon, the god of Air, Wind, andClouds (AL CG; Air, Animal, Chaos, Good, War). The holy symbol is an outline of a man with large eagle wings. The abbey contains a church and two back rooms. Under the altar (which swings aside) is a trapdoor to the treasure below (Search check, DC 20). There is also a secret passage (Search check, DC 20) exiting at a clump of bushes behind the abbey. From the outside this exit can only be opened by a knock  spell. Beyond these bushes, at the stockade wall, is a secret passage (Search check, DC 20) under that wall. The passage begins and ends a full 40 feet from the wall.\n\nThe abbey treasure is 2200 gp, 1725 sp, and gems—8 x 100 gp, 6 x 200 gp, 4 x 300 gp, and 4 x 500 gp. There is a blast glyph of warding  for 3d8 points of electrical damage on the trap door and the exit to the outside. Only the abbot knows where the treasure room and secret passages are located.\n\nThe rectory has six rooms: one for the abbot, one for the curate, one for the 3 secondary clergy, and one for the 8 acolytes. The remaining rooms are a kitchen/common room and a copy/study room.\n\nThe clergy of the abbey are listed below, with the abbot at the end of the roster.\n\nAlmon:  Male Human Cleric (Phaulkon) 4; CR 4; Medium-Size Humanoid; HD 4d8; hp 17; Init +0; Spd 20 ft.

(chainmail +2), base 30 ft.; AC 18 (+1 Dex, +7 chainmail +2); Atk +6 melee (1d8+2 and disruption, heavy mace of disruption +1); SA spells; SQ turn undead; AL NG/NE; SV Fort +6, Ref +3, Will +9; Str 13, Dex 13, Con 12, Int 13, Wis 18, Cha 10.\n\nSkills and Feats:Concentration +10, Diplomacy +9, Knowledge (religion) +10, Spellcraft +10; Alertness, Brew Potion, Improved Initiative, Scribe Scroll.\nSQ: Turn Undead (Su): Qualton can turn undead 3 times per day.\nPossessions: Chainmail +2, heavy mace of disruption +1, holy symbol, pouch with 1–100 gp and an aquamarine gem (300 gp).\nSpells Prepared (5/4/4/3): 0—Create Water, Inflict Minor Wounds, Mending, Read Magic, Resistance; 1st—Cause Fear, Detect Good, Doom, Inflict Light Wounds;2nd—Augury, Darkness, Hold Person, Silence; 3rd—Blindness, Contagion, Glyph of Warding.\nDomain Spells: 1st—Obscuring Mist; 2nd—Wind Wall; 3rd—Gaseous Form. (Qualton’s domains are Air and Good.)\n\nQualton was neutral good but lately has begun to shift toward neutral evil. This is due to an ill-fated bout with a psionic blast that caused a form of schizophrenia in which he is perfectly normal at one moment and a megalomaniac at other times. In his megalomaniac state he desires to gain the throne by marrying Andrella (though she knows nothing of his plan or desires). Qualton’s true feelings are far more likely to surface with time (see module L2). A detect evil  will not show anything if he is in a normal state, and he does not have control over his transformations, or, at least he currently does not. He secretly prays to an evil deity for his third level spells. He is hesitant about leading services to Phaulkonbut is still capable of doing so.\n\nDM Note: If you plan to use this module with others from the Lendore Isle series do not allow Qualton’s schizophrenia to surface.\n\n18.\tGUARDPOST\n\nThis is a small guardpost. Guards based here patrol this side of the river and during times of alert man guardpost 39. None of these guards seek adventure. They are:\n\nColemack: Male Human Warrior 2; CR 1; Medium-Size Humanoid; HD 2d8+4; hp 19; Init +3 (Dex); Spd 20 ft.

He has a good wine cellar and the beer and ale are also good. He has two waitresses/cooks and a stable boy working for him. They are 1st level commoners and have no information of value. Gellcuff cannot be hired. The inn bank contains 112 gp, 88 ep, 67 sp, and 65 cp.\n\n20.\tTHE TAVERN OF THE WEST WIND\n\nThis establishment is operated by two magic-users, both of whom have families. The tavern sells beer and hard liquor only. Its six rooms rent for 12 sp a night.

Remember that if a familiar dies, its master must make a successful Fortitude save (DC15) to lose only 100 XP per wizard level. Failure means the loss of 200 XP per wizard level.\n\n21.\tPELLTAR’S HOME.\n\nThis is the home of Pelltar the wizard. All doors have complex locks (DC 30) and all four doors to the inside are arcane locked (DC 35 to break). The inner hall doors (front and back) have explosive runes (caster level 9) on them.\n\nThree magic-users are living with him and being trained in spellcasting. Each is in the process of copying spells and thus has his own book.\n\nPelltar:Male Human Wizard 9; CR 9; Medium-Size Humanoid; HD 9d4+18; hp 45; Init +2 (Dex); Spd 30 ft.; AC 18 (+2 Dex, +6bracers of armor +6); Atk +6 melee (1d4+2, 19–20/x2, dagger +1—Monstrous Humanoid Bane); SA spells; AL LN; SV Fort +7, Ref +7, Will +9; Str 12, Dex 15, Con 15, Int 19, Wis 13, Cha 13.\n\nSkills and Feats:  Concentration +8, Diplomacy (cc) +6, Intimidate (cc) +4, Knowledge (arcana) +10, Knowledge (history) +10, Knowledge (local) +10, Knowledge (nobility) +13, Knowledge (planes) +10, Scry +10, Spellcraft +13; Brew Potion, Combat Casting, Craft Arms and Armor, Craft Wand, Scribe Scroll, Silent Spell, Spell Focus (enchantment).\nPossessions: Boots of levitation, bracers of armor +6, cloak of resistance +2, dagger +1—Monstrous Humanoid Bane, wand of lightning bolt (11 charges), pouch with 1–20 pp and 3 x 100 gp gems.\nSpells Prepared(4/5/5/4/3/1): 0—Dancing Lights, Flare, Light, Read Magic; 1st—Charm Person, Erase, Identify, Sleep, Magic Missile;  2nd—Arcane Lock, Detect Thoughts, Knock, Shatter, Web; 3rd—Dispel Magic, Fly, Lightning Bolt, Suggestion; 4th—Dimension Door, Polymorph Other, Wall of Fire;5th—Summon Monster V.\nSpellbook: 1st—Burning Hands, Enlarge, Hold Person, Spider Climb; 2nd—Invisibility, Levitate, Locate Object, Magic Mouth, Protection from Arrows; 3rd—Blink, Explosive Runes; 4th—Charm Monster, Fire Shield, Fire Trap, Ice Storm; 5th—Animate Dead, Cone of Cold, Teleport, Wall of Iron; 6th—Antimagic Field.\n\nPelltar is very imperious and highly independent. If charmed he will not give up his wand nor will he give up his book of spells. Such a request will break a charm immediately. A request for a different item will allow him a save at once. He will be furious if an attempt is made tocharm  him. He keeps a book here as well as an exact duplicate in the tower of the castle. They contain the spells he has memorized plus the following:\n\nWith the book are 10 gems worth 250 gp each.\n\nPelltar might sell the bestowal of a spell he is capable of casting. The chances are 60% for a 1st level spell, 50% for a 2nd level spell, 40% for a 3rd level spell, etc. He sells these spells for 300 gp/level of the spell. The three magic-users who stay with Pelltar are loyal to him.  Each wears a ring that will negate the arcane lock for three full seconds before the door slams shut again. A ring might work on other arcane locked doors at the dispel magic  formula (caster level 9). Pelitar might release one of these magic-users from service for 1000 gp per level of experience.\n\nAbracus:Male Human Wizard 3; CR 3; Medium-Size Humanoid; HD 3d4+6; hp 15; Init +2 (Dex); Spd 30 ft.; AC 14 (+2 Dex, +2bracers of armor +2); Atk +3 melee (1d4+2, 19–20/x2, dagger); SA spells; AL LN; SV Fort +3, Ref +3, Will +4; Str 15, Dex 15, Con 14, Int 16, Wis 13, Cha 8.\n\nSkills and Feats:Concentration +8, Knowledge (arcana) +9, Knowledge (planes) +9, Spellcraft +9, Search (cc) +6; Brew Potion, Combat Casting, Scribe Scroll.\nPossessions: Bracers of armor +2, dagger, pouch with 18 gp, 11 sp.\nSpells Prepared (4/3/2): 0—Flare, Mage Hand, Ray of Frost, Read Magic; 1st—Charm Person, Enlarge, Sleep; 2nd—Invisibility, Web.\nSpellbook: 1st—Burning Hands, Spider Climb;2nd—Levitate.\n\nFliban:Male Human Wizard 3; CR 3; Medium-Size Humanoid; HD 3d4+9; hp 19; Init +3 (Dex); Spd 30 ft.; AC 15 (+3 Dex, +2 ring of protection +2); Atk +1 melee (1d4, 19–20/x2, dagger); SA spells; AL LN; SV Fort +4, Ref +4, Will +5; Str 10, Dex 16, Con 16, Int 15, Wis 15, Cha 12.\n\nSkills and Feats:Concentration +9, Knowledge (arcana) +8, Knowledge (planes) +8, Spellcraft +8; Combat Casting, Scribe Scroll, Spell Focus (evocation).\nPossessions:Dagger, ring of protection +2,pouch with 37 gp and a 150 gp gem.\nSpells Prepared (4/3/2): 0—Dancing Lights, Light, Mage Hand, Read Magic; 1st—Magic Missile (2), Sleep; 2nd—Web (2).\n\nGristla: Male Human Wizard 4; CR 4; Medium-Size Humanoid; HD 4d4+8; hp 21; Init +1 (Dex); Spd 30 ft.; AC 14 (+1 Dex, +3 bracers of armor +3); Atk +2 melee (1d4, 19–20/x2, dagger); SA spells; AL LN; SV Fort +3, Ref +2, Will +5; Str 11, Dex 13, Con 14, Int 17, Wis 13, Cha 13.\n\nSkills and Feats:Concentration +9, Knowledge (arcana) +10, Knowledge (planes) +10, Scry +10, Spellcraft +10; Brew Potion, Combat Casting, Scribe Scroll.\nPossessions: Bracers of armor +3,dagger, scroll of fireball (caster level 8), pouch with 18 gp.\nSpells Prepared (4/4/3): 0—Dancing Lights, Light, Mage Hand, Read Magic; 1st—Charm Person (2), Enlarge, Magic Missile (2); 2nd—Detect Thoughts (2), Invisibility.\nSpellbook: 1st—Sleep; 2nd—Levitate, Stinking Cloud.\n\n22.\tFELIX'S HOME\n\nThis is the home of Felix the mercenary.\n\nFelix: Male Human Fighter 4; CR 4; Medium-Size Humanoid; HD 4d10+8; hp 33; Init +1 (Dex); Spd 20 ft.

He lives with a young female 1st-level commoner who has a charisma of 18.\n\n23, 24, 25. WAREHOUSES\n\nThe guard who patrols these three warehouses lives at location 26 and is detailed there. The warehouses are as follows:\n\n\n23:\tThis is a storage building for grain and preserved foods. The value of the foodstuffs is 480 gp.\n\n24:\tThe fishermen store their boats in this building. Construction and repair of boats also goes on inside. The Baron lets the fishermen use it for free.\n\n25:\tThis warehouse belongs to Pelltar, who also pays the guard’s wages. Inside is fine food (value: 700 gp), aging wines (value: 900 gp), hard whiskey (value: 800 gp), iron rations (value: 250 gp), fine clothing (value: 800 gp), four sets of half-plate armor (value: 600 gp each), copper mugs, jugs, and cups (value: 340 gp), three tapestries (value: 400, 500, and 700 gp), and a suite of padded leather furniture worth 1200 gp.

(see Baron’s castle room 2.)\n\nThe war dogs are highly-trained, alert, and vicious. They obey Welcar or Pelltar but they will not take food from anyone else. Welcar has a small private treasure of 320 ep and a gem valued at 700 gp. His magical rope and ring were given to him by Pelltar as part of his equipment.\n\n30.\tBAIT SHOP\n\nZahrdahl poses as a bait dealer poor and dirty, but is really an illusionist spy for the Duke of Kroten to the northwest.\n\nZahrdahl:Male Human Wizard (Illusionist) 3; CR 3; Medium-Size Humanoid; HD 3d4+9; hp 15; Init +3 (Dex); Spd 30 ft.; AC 18 (+3 Dex, +5 bracers of armor +5); Atk +2 melee (1d4+1, 19–20/x2, dagger); AL NE; SA spells; SV Fort +4, Ref +4, Will +4; Str 12, Dex 16, Con 16, Int 15, Wis 13, Cha 10.\n\nSkills and Feats:Concentration +9, Gather Information (cc) +3, Knowledge (arcana) +8, Profession (fisher) +7, Spellcraft +8; Combat Casting, Scribe Scroll, Silent Spell, Spell Focus (illusion).\nPossessions: Bracers of armor +5, dagger, pouch with 1–10 sp.\nSpells Prepared (4/4/3): 0—Dancing Lights, Detect Magic, Ghost Sound, Mage Hand; 1st—Color Spray (x2),  Fog Cloud, Silent Image; 2nd—Invisibility, Misdirection, See Invisibility.\n Spellbook:1st—Ventriloquism;2nd—Glitterdust, Hypnotic Pattern.\n\nHis spellbook is hidden and has explosive runes (placed by a friendly 11th level wizard) on its cover.

He is the spiritual advisor of the Baroness.\n\nYalta: Male Human Cleric (Pelor) 3; CR 3; Medium-Size Humanoid; HD 3d8+6; hp 21; Init +1 (Dex); Spd 20 ft. (masterwork chainmail), base 30 ft.; AC 19 (+1 Dex, +5 masterwork chainmail, +3 large steel shield +1); Atk +5 melee (1d8+3, heavy mace +1); AL LG; SA spells; SV Fort +5, Ref +2, Will +5; Str 15, Dex 13, Con 15, Int 14, Wis 14, Cha 17.\n\nSkills and Feats:Concentration +8, Diplomacy +9, Heal +8, Knowledge (religion) +8, Spellcraft +8; Alertness, Combat Casting, Scribe Scroll.\nPossessions: Masterwork chainmail, heavy mace +1, large steel shield +1, pouch with 48 gp.\nSpells Prepared (4/3/2): 0—Cure Minor Wounds, Detect Magic, Light, Virtue; 1st—Bless, Command, Detect Evil; 2nd—Aid, Hold Person.\nDomain Spells: 1st—Cure Light Wounds; 2nd—Cure Moderate Wounds. (Yalta’s domains are Good and Healing.)\n\nHe can be hired, but the party leader must be lawful and at least 4th level.\n\n32.\tBURNT GUARD STATION\n\nThis is the shell of a burned-out guard station. Since the building is mainly stone the outward damage is not easily visible from a distance. The lower secret chambers shelter various undead, and there is also a dire rat nest consisting of several burrowed  out chambers. The giant rats occasionally forage in the town as far up the road as the fresh food stand of 29.  A town visitor might be told that a large rat bit the child of a fisherman. This story is most likely to be heard at 14  or 19, but is also known at 31  and the buildings on the hill (16, 17, 18). The townspeople are concerned but there is no one to track down the rats and some feel the incident was an isolated one. If the people along this small road are questioned they will have much more to say.\n\nThe chance of a dire rat being in town is 25% (only at night when there is little or no street traffic). A large party will almost surely be detected by a rat unless they are quite spread out.\n\nTHE GUARD HOUSE:\n\n1.\tTHE COMMON ROOM.\n\nThis was the site of the major fire so all refuse is burnt. Tracks of a dire rat can be found coming in and out. The tracks are over 72 hours old (Track/Wilderness Lore check, DC 19).\n\n2.\tTHE BARRACKS\n\nThe fire did some damage to this section. The roof is burned away over the hole in the walls. All six cots were burned. There is no item of value.\n\n3.\tTHE ARMORY\n\nSome wooden items are here but those that are not burnt are warped and useless. These include two short bows, three shortspears, four axes, two halberds, and eighty arrows.\n\n4.\tTHE EMPTY CELL.\n\nThis was a temporary cell. The door was broken down but the fire did not get in here. Someone/something else did the breaking (actually, to free the prisoner during the fire).\n\n5.\tTHE BEDROOM\n\nThis room was not burned and items of value have long ago been removed. A bed, table, chairs, and a four-drawer chest are still here. A poison needle trap:  CR 2; +8 ranged (1); Search (DC 22); Disable Device (DC 20) is still here but the poison is useless. There is a secret door (Search check, DC 20) to 6 under the remains of a rotting carpet.\n\nTHE LOWER-LEVELS (SECRET COMPLEX).\n\nThis complex was built almost a century before and the secret door to it was forgotten long ago. The undead have been here, undisturbed, for that entire period. The complex was designed by a thief as a private lair where he could defend himself against a small party. There are a series of secret doors (Search check, DC 20)in Location 11 and 12. They open by hidden mechanisms from both sides. The mechanisms arepositioned differently on each door. Thus, their position must be located and memorized. The undead do not know that these passages exist. The secret doors will automatically close and relock in one minute. They are operated by counter-weights heavy enough  to dislodge or break an iron spike (85% chance).\n\n6.\tTHE LIVING CHAMBER.\n\nWhen the party enters the room, they are immediately attacked by two skeletons and a ghoul.\n\nSkeletons (2): CR 1/3; Medium-Size Undead; HD 1d12; hp 9, 8; Init +5 (+1 Dex, +4 Improved Initiative); Spd 30 ft.; AC 13 (+1 Dex, +2 natural); Atk +0 melee (1d4, 2 claws); SQ undead, immunities; AL N; SV Fort +0, Ref +1, Will +2; Str 10, Dex 12, Con —, Int —, Wis 10, Cha 1.\n\nFeats: Improved Initiative.\n\nGhoul:  CR 1; Medium-Size Undead; HD 2d12; hp 18; Init +2 (Dex); Spd 30 ft.; AC 14 (+2 Dex, +2 natural); Atk +3 melee (1d6+1 and paralysis, bite) and +0 melee (1d3 and paralysis, 2 claws); SA paralysis, create spawn; SQ undead, +2 turn resistance; AL CE; SV Fort+0, Ref +2, Will +5; Str 13, Dex 15, Con —, Int 13, Wis 14, Cha 16.\n\nSkills and Feats: Climb +6, Escape Artist +7, Hide +7, Intuit Direction +3, Jump +6, Move Silently +7, Search +6, Spot +7; Multiattack, Weapon Finesse (bite).\n\nThe remains of a large hexagonal table and six hexagonal benches remain, though they are quite rotten and will collapse if sat upon. There is a hexagonal bed, also rotten, which will explode into dust if someone jumps on it or tries to tear it apart. An iron bound chest is in one of the alcoves. The chest has a trap on the lock. If it is not found and disarmed it will pour a vial of liquid into the chest as the lock is turned. Tipping the air-tight chest will also pour out the liquid. The liquid is a special mixture of a potion of gaseous form. It will cause the entire chest and its contents to become gaseous for twenty minutes. The gas will float around harmlessly until the time limit is up. The cloud will resist being broken up by wind; even a gust of wind spell will have no effect. When the time has elapsed the chest will reform and crash to the floor. This is 70% likely to break the potion of gaseous form  therein and the entire chest will then go gaseous again for two full hours. Inside the chest, among the bits of clothing of no real value, is a dagger with a belt and elaborate buckle and wooden box 4 in. square. The dagger is ornate but non-magical. Thebuckle is valued at 10 gp but if it is unbuckled in the normal way it is 85% likely to stick the wearer, or the person removing it, with a pin. The pin has enough  carrion crawler brain juice (contact; DC 13; primary damage paralysis 2d6 minutes, secondary damage 0) on it for three injections. The box contains a medallion of wakefulness.

The chair and bed are  so old they will disintegrate if someone sits on them. A stash of 70 gp, 80 ep, and 40 sp is inside the false bottom of the footlocker (Search DC 17).\n\n8.\tKITCHEN AND PANTRY\n\nThis room is guarded by two ghouls and two zombies.\n\nGhouls (2):  CR 1; Medium-Size Undead; HD 2d12; hp 19, 18; Init +2 (Dex); Spd 30 ft.; AC 14 (+2 Dex, +2 natural); Atk +3 melee (1d6+1 and paralysis, bite) and +0 melee (1d3 and paralysis, 2 claws); SA paralysis, create spawn; SQ undead, +2 turn resistance; AL CE; SV Fort +0, Ref +2, Will +5; Str 13, Dex 15, Con —, Int 13, Wis 14, Cha 16.\n\nSkills and Feats: Climb +6, Escape Artist +7, Hide +7, Intuit Direction +3, Jump +6, Move Silently +7, Search +6, Spot +7; Multiattack, Weapon Finesse (bite).\n\nZombies (2): CR 1/2; Medium-Size Undead; HD 2d12+3; hp 20, 19; Init –1 (Dex); Spd 30 ft.; AC 11 (–1 Dex, +2 natural); Atk +2 melee (1d6+1, slam); SQ Undead, partial actions only; AL N; SV Fort +0, Ref –1, Will +3; Str 13, Dex 8, Con _—, Int —, Wis 10, Cha 1.\n\nFeats: Toughness.\n\nThey attack immediately when the party enters. This room has many storage shelves with food containers on them. The food is all rotten. A table and two chairs are in this long, curved chamber plus a small hearth (long since closed to the outside), a weapon rack with 6 rotting shortspears, and a cabinet with pots, pans, utensils, etc.\n\n9.\tTHE GAME ROOM\n\nA skeleton and a ghoul are inside this room. The ghoul will usually be in the recessed area. They attack immediately when the party enters.\n\nSkeleton: CR 1/3; Medium-Size Undead; HD 1d12; hp 9; Init +5 (+1 Dex, +4 Improved Initiative); Spd 30 ft.; AC 13 (+1 Dex, +2 natural); Atk +0 melee (1d4, 2 claws); SQ undead, immunities; AL N; SV Fort +0, Ref +1, Will +2; Str 10, Dex 12, Con —, Int —, Wis 10, Cha 1.\n\nFeats: Improved Initiative.\n\nGhoul:  CR 1; Medium-Size Undead; HD 2d12; hp 18; Init +2 (Dex); Spd 30 ft.; AC 14 (+2 Dex, +2 natural); Atk +3 melee (1d6+1 and paralysis, bite) and +0 melee (1d3 and paralysis, 2 claws); SA paralysis, create spawn; SQ undead, +2 turn resistance;  AL CE; SV Fort +0, Ref +2, Will +5; Str 13, Dex 15, Con —, Int 13, Wis 14, Cha 16.\n\nSkills and Feats: Climb +6, Escape Artist +7, Hide +7, Intuit Direction +3, Jump +6, Move Silently +7, Search +6, Spot +7; Multiattack, Weapon Finesse (bite).\n\nA large, hexagonal table is in the center of the room surrounded by six chairs. A throwing dagger is hidden under the table at each chair location. The remains of a deck of cards are present, it will crumble to dust if picked up—as well as six piles of copper pieces, numbering 20, 32, 12, 44, 49, and 15 respectively.\n\nNote: the opening into room 13, below.\n\n10.\tTHE PRACTICE RANGE\n\nThis room contains a knife rack with 8 rusted throwing knives. There is a table and a single chair. Four practice targets are on the east wall. Otherwise it is empty. The door to 10a  is still locked (DC 20) but will break on a successful Str check (DC 13).\n\n10a  is a tunnel passage that exits at a well-hidden location (Search check DC 18) in a clump of bushes near the river.\n\n11.\tTHE HIDDEN ROOM\n\nThis secret room has a small chest in the eastern niche. Inside the chest are the following: 77 gp, 38 ep, 105 sp, and a bag of 5 gems; 3 x 50 gp, 150 gp, and 200 gp. There is also a pair of boots of elvenkind.\n\n12.\tSECRET ROOM COMPLEX\n\nIn the room bordering room 8 is a small box containing a potion of cure moderate wounds.  The other room appears empty, but when its _doors are opened it will be flooded with insanity mist poison (inhaled; primary damage 1d4 Wis; secondary damage 2d6 Wis). Over the years the gas has become very weak (DC 10).\n\nTHE DIRE RAT NEST.\n\n13. The rats opened a hole here into room 9 but do not dare venture in. A decaying body of a dire rat lies near the opening. If there is a noise in room 9, 2–5 rats will scurry into 13 to investigate. Otherwise, this room will be empty.\n\n14. This is the major rat den. There are seven dire rats here.\n\nDire Rat (7): CR 1/3; Small Animal; HD 1d8+1; hp 9, 9, 9, 7, 7, 5, 5; Init +3 (Dex); Spd 40 ft., climb 20 ft.; AC 15 (+1 size, +3 Dex, +1 natural); Atk +4 melee (1d4 and disease, bite); AL N; SA disease; SQ scent; SV Fort +3, Ref +5, Will +3; Str 10, Dex 17, Con 12, Int 1, Wis 12, Cha 4.\n\nSkills and Feats: Climb +11, Hide +11, Move Silently +6; Weapon Finesse (bite).\nSA: Disease (Ex)—Filth fever, bite, Fortitude save (DC 12), incubation period 1d3 days; damage 1d3 temporary Dex and 1d3 temporary Con.\nSQ: Scent (Ex).\n\nIn the nest bedding are 7 gp, 11 ep, and a gem worth 50 gp.\n\n15. This is a breeding cave. There are 20 small rats here, effectively harmless due to their size. They have no attacks, are AC 10, and have 1 hp each. Unless they are killed they will grow large enough to forage in 10 days, and in 30 days they will have matured fully.\n\n16. There are 5 rats here.\n\nDire Rat (5):  CR 1/3; Small Animal; HD 1d8+1; hp 9, 9, 9, 7, 7; Init +3 (Dex); Spd 40 ft., climb 20 ft.; AC 15 (+1 size, +3 Dex, +1 natural); Atk +4 melee (1d4, bite); AL N; SA disease; SQ scent; SV Fort +3, Ref +5, Will +3; Str 10, Dex 17, Con 12, Int 1, Wis 12, Cha 4.\n\nSkills and Feats: Climb +11, Hide +11, Move Silently +6; Weapon Finesse (bite).\n\nMore might come if noise is made. Note the rat-sized tunnel at 16a, which exits in a well-hidden hole in a clump of bushes in the town.\n\n17. There are seven rats here.\n\nDire Rat (7):  CR 1/3; Small Animal; HD 1d8+1; hp 9, 9, 9, 9, 7, 7, 7; Init +3 (Dex); Spd 40 ft., climb 20 ft.; AC 15 (+1 size, +3 Dex, +1 natural); Atk +4 melee (1d4, bite); AL N; SA disease; SQ scent; SV Fort +3, Ref +5, Will +3; Str 10, Dex 17, Con 12, Int 1, Wis 12,  Cha 4.\n\nSkills and Feats: Climb +11, Hide +11, Move Silently +6; Weapon Finesse (bite).\n\nIn their nest is a ring of feather falling.\n\n18. There are nine rats here in this major nest.\n\nDire Rat (9):  CR 1/3; Small Animal; HD 1d8+1; hp 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 7, 7, 5, 5; Init +3 (Dex); Spd 40 ft., climb 20 ft.; AC 15 (+1 size, +3 Dex, +1 natural); Atk +4 melee (1d4, bite); AL N; SA disease; SQ scent; SV Fort +3, Ref +5, Will +3; Str 10, Dex 17, Con 12, Int 1, Wis 12, Cha 4.\n\nSkills and Feats: Climb +11, Hide +11, Move Silently +6; Weapon Finesse (bite).\n\nIn the bedding can be found 31 gp, 9 sp, and a brooch of shielding that can absorb 17 points of magic missiledamage. The tunnel 19a emerges in a well-hidden exit in a clump of bushes just beyond the town palisade. There is a 60% chance one dire rat will be in these bushes outside the hole, day or night.\n\n35.\tDRUID’S HOME\n\nThis is the home of Almax the druid, his son Amos, and his wife Felwin.\n\nAlmax: Male Human Druid 7; CR 7; Medium-Size Humanoid; HD 7d8+14; hp 61; Init +3 (Dex); Spd 30 ft.; AC 13 (+3 Dex); Atk +9 melee (1d6+4, club +2); AL N; SA spells; SQ druid skills; SV Fort +7, Ref +5, Will +8; Str 15, Dex 17, Con 14, Int 15, Wis 17, Cha 15.\n\nSkills and Feats: Animal Empathy +12, Concentration +12, Diplomacy +12, Heal +7, Knowledge (nature) +12, Scry +8, Spellcraft +12, Wilderness Lore +13; Alertness, Brew Potion, Quicken Spell, Scribe Scroll.\nSQ: Druid Skills (Su)—Nature Sense, Resist Nature’s Lure, Trackless Step, Wild Shape (3 times/day), Woodland Stride.\nPossessions: Club +2, ring of evasion.\nSpells Prepared (6/5/4/3/1): 0—Create Water, Detect Magic, Flare, Light, Read Magic, Virtue; 1st—Animal Friendship, Cure Light Wounds, Entangle, Faerie Fire, Shillelagh; 2nd—Charm Person or Mammal, Fire Trap, Heat Metal, Speak With Animals;3rd—Call Lightning, Neutralize Poison, Summon Nature’s Ally III; 4th—Dispel Magic.\n\nAmos: Male Half-Elf Druid 3; CR 3; Medium-Size Humanoid (Elf); HD 3d8+3; hp 20; Init +3 (Dex); Spd 30 ft.; AC 15 (+3 Dex, +2 leather armor); Atk +2 melee (1d6+2, 18–20/x2, scimitar), or +5 ranged (1d4, sling); AL N; SA spells; SQ druid skills, elven traits; SV Fort +4, Ref +4, Will +7; Str 10, Dex 16, Con 12, Int 14, Wis 18, Cha 17.\n\nSkills and Feats: Animal Empathy +9, Concentration +7, Heal +10, Knowledge (nature) +8, Spellcraft +8, Wilderness Lore +10; Brew Potion, Scribe Scroll.\nPossessions: Scimitar, sling with 20 bullets, studded leather armor, pouch with 80 gp.\nSQ: Druid Skills (Su)—Nature Sense, Trackless Step, Woodland Stride; Elven Traits (Ex).\nSpells Prepared (4/3/2): 0—Create Water, Cure Minor Wounds, Detect Magic, Light; 1st—Animal Friendship, Detect Animal or Plant, Faerie Fire; 2nd—Barkskin, Speak With Animals.\n\nHis father will be willing to send Amos on a mission concerning the town.\n\nFelwin:Female Elf Wizard 2; CR 2; Medium-Size Humanoid (Elf); HD 2d4+4; hp 10; Init +3 (Dex); Spd 30 ft.; AC 13 (+3 Dex); Atk +1 melee (1d4, 19–20/x2, dagger); AL CN; SA spells; SQ elven traits; SV Fort +4, Ref +5, Will +6; Str 10, Dex 16, Con 15, Int 14, Wis 13, Cha 16.\n\nSkills and Feats:Concentration +7, Hide (cc) +5 1/2, Knowledge (arcana) +7, Spellcraft +7; Scribe Scroll, Toughness.\nSQ: Elven Traits (Ex).\nPossessions: Cloak of resistance +2, dagger, pouch with 45 gp.\nSpells Prepared (4/3): 0—Dancing Lights, Light, Mage Hand, Read Magic; 1st—Charm Person, Message, Sleep.\n\nShe will not adventure.\n\nAlmax is second only to Pelltar in authority, after the Baron. He owns a Fountain of Good Health which bubbles up in the grove behind his home. It is protected by three snares (Search check, DC 23 rogue only) at each end of the two entrances. Worshippers are instructed never to enter this clump of trees behind his home. The Fountain has three powers:\n\n-\tUpon command it will create food and water for up to 12 persons for one week, once per day.\n\n-\tUpon command it can view other druid places of worship. Those known to Almax can be specifically called forth. Upon seeing the location the Fountain can  teleport up to six persons as they step into the waters. Each such figure must be touched by the druid who calls forth the image in the pool. This teleportation  can be two-way if a druid at the other end has any type of pool or fountain and is gazing into it when contact is established. Thus the Fountain  can be used as a means of gaining and giving information over long distances. Almax frequently looks into theFountain at high noon. He usually charges 75 gp per level for each person being transported.\n\n-\tUpon command the Fountain can bestow acure light wounds on those who bathe in the waters for not less than one hour. Up to 12 cures can be made per day in this way. Almax will charge 100 gp per person using the pool in this way.\n\nIf the Fountain is ever defiled, the offending party must be killed and thrown into the Fountain before it will function again. The Fountain may be defiled by bestow curse, desecrate, unholy water, garbage, or excreted waste. The DM can turn such an event into an interesting adventure!\n\nAmos and Felwin know of the Fountain but neither will approach it unless Almax  has been hurt or killed. Amos can use it. Hidden under stones near the pool are 8 gems valued as follows: 3 x 200 gp__, 4 x 300 gp, and 1000 gp. Each is buried apart from the others.\n\nCREDITS\n\nDESIGN:\tLenard Lakofka\n\nART:\tDavid S.

(good)\nAC: 16 (–1 size, +1 Dex, +6 natural)\nAttacks: Eye rays +4 ranged touch, bite –2 melee\nDamage: Bite 1d6\nFace/Reach: 5 ft. by 5 ft./5 ft.\nSpecial Attacks: Eye rays\nSpecial Qualities: All-around vision, reflection, fly, SR 12\nSaves: Fort +5, Ref  +5, Will +5\nAbilities: Str 10, Dex 12, Con 13, Int 14, Wis 13, Cha 13\nSkills: Diplomacy +10, Hide +2, Knowledge (planes) +9, Listen +10, Sense Motive +8, Spot +10\nFeats: Alertness, Flyby Attack\n—\nClimate/Terrain: Any land and underground\nOrganization: Solitary or pair\nChallenge Rating: 3\nTreasure: See below\nAlignment: Always lawful neutral\nAdvancement: 5–8 HD (Large); 9–12 HD (Huge)\n\nThe spectator is a guardian of places and treasures. Once it is given a task it will guard for up to 101 years and will let no one use, borrow, or examine a guarded item or treasure.\n\nThe spectator has a large central eye and four smaller eye stalks protruding from the top of its 4-foot-wide spherical body. The body surface is covered in tough hide. \n\nIf properly confronted, the spectator can be quite friendly. It will tell a party exactly what it is guarding  early in any conversation so that there will be no argument! If its charge is not threatened it can be quite amiable and even talkative (via telepathy).\n\nCombat\nThe spectator, being basically passive, will attempt to communicate and implant itssuggestion as its first act unless it is immediately attacked.\n\nEye Rays (Su): Each of the four small eyes can produce a magical ray once a round, even when the spectator is attacking physically or moving at full speed. The creature can aim all its eyes in any direction.\n\nEach eye’s effect resembles a spell cast by a 6th-level sorceror but follows the rules for a ray (see Aiming a Spell, page 148 in the Player’s Handbook). All rays have a range of 90 feet and a save DC of 12.\n\nCreate Food and Water:This works like the spell, except the casting time is only one minute. The spectator can create enough food for eighteen humans or six horses. Obviously this is not an attack.\n\nInflict Moderate Wounds:This works just like the spell, causing 2d8+6 points of damage (Will half).\n\nHold Monster (extended): This works just like the spell, freezing in place a creature unless it makes a successful Will save, for 12 rounds. The spectator never attacks a held  creature or uses it for food. A held creature might be allowed to go its own way if it is willing to leave in peace.\n\nTelepathy: Communication with one creature is possible in this way. The beast can also implant a suggestion, as the spell, if the target fails at a Will save. This suggestion is always to leave in peace.\n\nReflection (Su): When the central eye is undamaged, it can reflect one spell per round fired at it and turn the spell back to the caster, as thespell turning  spell. The central eye can only reflect one spell per round. The reflection only occurs if the spectator makes a saving throw vs. spell (regardless of the spell cast at it). Because of this power and its magic resistance a spectator gains no other savingthrows vs. magic. Example: a magic-user casts alightning bolt at a spectator, the spectator rolls a saving throw to see if the spell is reflected, and if it is not then its magic resistance percentage is rolled for. If this also fails the lightning bolt  does full damage. The spell caster is allowed a normal saving throw vs. the reflected spell in all cases and only he or she must suffer any damage. Thus, in the above example, if thelightning bolt  were reflected only the magic-user could be hit by it, even if a familiar, for example, were sitting on the magic-user’s shoulder. If the magic-user makes the saving throw he or she takes no damage whatsoever! Reflection is possible only if the spell caster is in a 60¡ arc of the central eye. Range is not a factor, since getting the spell to the spectator is the only consideration. \n\nAll-Around Vision (Ex):Spectators are extremely alert, due to their nature. Their many eyes give them a +4 racial bonus to Spot and Search checks, and they can’t be flanked.\n\nFlight (Ex): A spectator’s body is naturally buoyant. This buoyancy allows it to fly as the spell, as a free action, at a speed of 30 ft. This buoyancy also grants it a permanent  feather fall effect with personal range. They will drift aimlessly when asleep, (20% likely when encountered), never touching the ground.\n\nSpectator Society\n\nSpectators are summoned from Nirvana by the spell summon monster V  and the sacrifice of three small eyes (or more) from a beholder. The spectator can only be commanded to guard some treasure. It will perform no other duty, and if commanded in some other way it will return to Nirvana immediately. If its guarded item(s) is ever destroyed or successfully stolen the spectator is released from service and may return to Nirvana as well. The summoner, of course, may take the item himself and thus release the spectator.\n\nThe treasure being guarded is 90% likely to be a magic item or at least a value of 15,000 gp. Incidental treasure gained while performing its duty has no hold on its conscience and may be taken freely. Incidental treasure can amount to the following sums:40% for 3–300 coins of mixed types, (1–20 platinum, 2–40 gold, 4–80 electrum, and the balance, if any, will be silver), 30% for 1–6 gems of base value 50 g.p., 20% for 1–4 potions, 15% for a +1 piece of armor, 15% for a + 1 weapon, and 5% for a miscellaneous magic item valued under 10,000 gp.\n\nA blinded spectator cannot defend its treasure and will teleport to Nirvana. This is the only condition under which it will leave its post. Its eyes regenerate in one day and then it will return. If the treasure is gone it will return to Nirvana.\n(portions taken from the beholder entry in the Monster Manual, page 24–25.)\n\nSTONE GUARDIAN\nMedium-Size Construct\n\nHit Dice: 3d10 (16 hp)\nInitiative: +0\nSpeed: 30 ft.\nAC: 18 (+8 natural)\nAttacks: 2 slams +3 melee\nDamage: Slam 1d8+1\nFace/Reach: 5 ft. by 5 ft./5 ft.\nSpecial Qualities: Construct, immunities, fire resistance 10, cold resistance 10, electricity resistance 10, see invisibility\nSaves: Fort +0, Ref +1, Will +1\nAbilities: Str 13, Dex 10, Con —, Int —, Wis 10, Cha 1\n—\nClimate/Terrain: Any land\nOrganization: Solitary or gang (1–4)\nChallenge Rating: 3\nTreasure: None\nAlignment: Always neutral\nAdvancement: 3 HD (Medium-Size); 4 HD (Large)\n\nA stone guardian can be as small as a man or as large as an ogre (10 feet tall) and weighs between 250 and 450 pounds. Its body is rough stone, with crude features.\n\nCombat\n\nConstruct: Immune to mind-influencing effects, poison, disease, and similar effects. Not subject to critical hits, subdual damage, ability damage, energy drain, or death from massive damage.\n\nImmunities (Ex): A Stone guardian takes only half damage from piercing or slashing weapons. Stone to flesh, transmute rock to mud, or stone shape spells will kill it instantly with no saving throw.\n\nSee Invisibility (Sp): A stone guardian can continuously see invisbility as cast by a 3rd-level sorceror, but only if the spell was cast as part of the creation process (see below).\n\nConstruction\nA stone guardian’s body is made from mud, weighing between 250 and 400 pounds. The body is given a heart of stone.\n\nThe guardian costs 10,000 gp to create, which includes 500 gp for the construction of the body. Assembling the body requires a successful Craft (sculpting or masonry) check (DC 13).\n\nThe creator must be 13th level and be able to cast arcane spells. The creator must also have the Craft Magic Arms and Armor and Craft Wondrous Item feats. Completeing the ritual drains 200 XP from the creator and requires transmute mud to rock, magic mouth,and limited wish or wish. Magic mouth is required so that it can be activated under precise circumstances. However, there is a 20% chance per activation that the precise instructions will be disregarded and then the stone guardian will attack anything! See invisibility  is optional, but no other spell may be substituted for it.\n\nA special ring of protection from stone guardians  can be crafted at the same time a stone guardian is manufactured. This ring will keep the wearer and all others within a 10 ft. radius immune to a guardian’s attack. The ring will only work for the stone guardian(s) made at the time the ring was crafted and will be useless against other stone guardians.\n\nNEW MAGIC ITEMS\n\nMirror of Opposition (variant):  This item resembles a mirror 2 feet wide and 5 feet high. It is activated and deactivated by a command word. A character will be drawn into the mirror upon seeing his or her reflection. This person will then materialize on a flat plane with an endless horizon in all directions. Opposite the character, at a distance of 40 to 240 feet (4d6 x 10), is an exact duplicate of him/herself. The duplicate is complete in every way including magic items, spells (only those currently memorized or granted and still unused), weapons, armor, etc. Its hit points are equal to the character’s current hit points. The DM must play the duplicate and melee will begin at once. Note that the DM cannot use items unknown to the player. Any fair random method of trying to use an unknown item is allowed. The real player will find that wish, limited wish, word of recall,or teleport will notrelease him or her but the spell will be used up. Other party members are powerless to help unless they, too, go into the mirror, but then this process will form duplicates of them as well. If multiple characters go into the mirror either the duplicates or  the originals may gang up on the survivors. Once all characters or duplicates are destroyed the magic ends. A dead character is lost forever unless someone goes into the particular mirror, defeats his or her own double, and brings back the body for a raise dead  spell or other resurrection-type magic. The recovery must be done within one day or the real body and all items are lost. The items must make a successful Fort save (DC 15) or be destroyed. If they successfully save they are teleported elsewhere in the Prime Material Plane for others to find. Artifacts and relics are always teleported, as are swords with a purpose. Breaking the mirror while the melee is in progress kills all characters inside forever even if they had won.\n\nCaster Level:15th; Prerequisites: Craft Wondrous Item, clone, imprisonment; Market Price: 280,000 gp; Weight: 45 lb.\n\n\nSAMPLE PLAYER CHARACTERS\n\nThese characters may be used in L1 for players who do not have characters of appropriate level to use or for those who do not have time to create characters of their own.\n\nMale Human Fighter 4; Medium-Size Humanoid; HD 4d10+4; hp 25; Init +1 (Dex); Spd 20 ft.

Most guards have been changed from fighters to warriors, except the Captain of the Guard. Weapons for rogues and druids have been changed to fit the class restrictions from the Player’s Handbook.  Armor classes and hit points are adjusted for the 3rd Edition ability modifiers. Spells prepared are increased to account for bonus spells. Some characters are given ability scores from the NPC statistics section of the DUNGEON MASTER’S Guide, pages 49–57. Characters of 4th level and above have their ability score addition.\n   The number of platinum pieces, silver pieces, and copper pieces have been halved to account for the doubling of value from 1st Edition to 3rd Edition. The ep (electrum piece) is worth 1/2 gp.\n\nPage 4\nGiant Octopus: CR 8; Large Animal (Aquatic); HD 8d8+8; hp 45; Init +2 (Dex); Spd 20 ft., swim 30 ft.; AC 18 (–1 size, +2 Dex, +7 natural); Atk +10 melee (1d4+5 [x8], 8 tentacle rakes), and +5 melee(1d8+2, bite); Reach 10 ft.; SA improved grab, constrict; SQ ink cloud, jet; AL N; SV Fort +7, Ref +8, Will +3; Str 20, Dex 15, Con 13, Int 2, Wis 12, Cha 3.\n\nSkills:Hide +11, Listen +4, Spot +4.

He is still a bit pale, and weak looking too, even though he feels his recovery is far \n\nenough along to warrant mounting this expedition. To you, it’s doubtful he could put to \nsea in a calm, let alone now, with the wind whistling in the night, the surf up, and the \nwaves pounding the nearby docks. You can hear the wind and the waves clearly, even \nover the singing bard, and his drum, and over all the rest of the noise in the Inn, even \nthough you are several blocks from the ocean. Hopefully, you think… the storm should \nlet up by morning. \n \nThe fire burns low in the hearth of the seaside Inn that serves as your home for this \nnight. The captain gets up without saying another word and ambles over to the fine oak \nbar and pushes his mug to the bartender, motioning for a refill. A moment later he \nreturns. You notice that for all his apparent carelessness, and even with the odd way he \nlimps, not a drop of ale has been spilled. \n \nThe music begins to play again, louder now, drowning out the low conversations going on in the tables around \nyou. As the bard returns to telling of the saga of the Emerald Princess for all in the Inn to hear, all of you begin \ntalking in low tones amongst each other discussing what you learned this evening. \n \n“Can we talk about this betwixt ourselves?” you hear yourself saying to Captain Ari. The former Captain of the \nEmerald Princess… \n \n“Aye,” He answers getting up again. “I’ll be back afore the mids watch to see if you made up yuh minds.” With \nthat, he limps over to another table nearby and sits down, introducing himself to the hearty sea dogs there, who, \nhad up until the time he walked over, been busy cheering the storyteller on, and asking the bard questions as well.  \n \n“Maybe it’s all a scam.” \n \n“Mebbe we can find it on our own…” \n \n“It’s in six fathoms of water, how do you suppose we should recover the heavier items?” \n \n“What if the sand has covered it, or the tides have moved it… what then?” \n \n“Equal shares for everyone in the expedition, with two shares for the Captain, and all officers… What do you \nthink we should do? What would warrant an extra share?” \n \nThe conversation goes on for a bit, and finally you all put it to a vote. \n \n“OK, it’s settled then… At dawn, we accompany the Captain Ari in his hired boat to recover the treasures of the \nsunken Emerald Princess… We agree then? 100 coins each, plus an equal share for each, of whatever we find in \nthe briny drink.” \n \n“Now, whom amongst us, are we going to elect as our officer… remember it’s 200 gold coins, and two shares of \ntreasure for each officer. Each of us will state our qualification to lead… starting with you… and then we’ll vote \non it.” \n \n\nT \n\n\n\nAll eyes turn to you expectantly, and the sea captain, sensing you all have made up your minds, gets up a bit \nstiffly, and comes back over to the table to hear why you are best qualified to be leader of your group in the \nrecovery expedition. The rain falls hard on the roof of the Inn, making you glad you paid for a nights’ stay… \n\nDM’s Notes for Last Voyage of the Emerald Princess \nThis is a recovery adventure designed for four to six first to third level players. The players are to accompany \nCaptain Ari and his crew to the site of the sunken Emerald Princess. The players are to serve as guards, and are to \nhelp Captain Ari in any other way that the captain requests in the recovery of valuables from the wreck of the \nEmerald Princess in return for a share of the proceeds. Here begins the rest of this story, a story the players should \nuncover, as a ship chartered by Captain Ari, the Torshayn, will make the journey to the site of the shipwreck. \nIf the players are all 1st to 3rd level, they should avoid getting into melee with the bad guy and his followers in this \nadventure without having Captain Ari, and at least some of the Captain Ari’s followers with them as they would \nbe outmatched. It’s an open-ended adventure, the players may also opt to join Lithwyn (The Bad Guy). \n \nDuring the journey to the shipwreck, the 2nd mate, Ivar, will approach the players and ask the players if they know \nof the whole tale of the Emerald Princess.  He will, after a short time getting to know the players, tell the story of \nthe night when ship struck the reef. \n \n“The Emerald Princess was our good luck charm, to be sure… twenty-six paces from stem to stern, eight paces at \nthe beam, with two masts, four mainsails, two top sails, and a fore sail, she could make one hundred and seventy \nmiles a day with moderate winds. By Janu, we once we even got her up to fourteen knots in the mouth of a great \nstorm… we did. She always rode like a spirit on the winds. With less than a fathom o’ draft we always outran, or \nwe outmaneuvered the pirates hereabouts. The Princess’s luck simply ran dry that day though.” \n \n“This all happn’d a bit o’er a month ago mind you… twas an ordinary night, like any other… The first mate \nLithwyn took over after three bells, shortly after sunset. We were running southwesterly, and were about three \ndays from where we are right now. Lithwyn had put up a watch on the masts, to warn of shallows, or reefs. Still, \ntwas dark that night, it was, there was little moonlight to see by, and the sea was dark as pitch. I know, for after \neve’nen mess, I went up on deck for a  bit to get some air afore callin in for the night. ” \n \n“After my stroll, I went below to check on our cargo, you know? Makin sure the water in the hold was bein \npumped out faster –n- twas comin in… makin sure our cargo stayed dry... The Cap’n had made port in Aiulla, \nand we took on a good quantity of tools, along with a dozen boxes of long swords, and several crates of armor for \nan elven buyer. We also were carry’n vats and vases o’ olive oil, fresh fruit, and a small quantity of cedar boards. \nWe already had stowed many barrels of butternuts, and pecans, several crates o’ eggplants, ‘n spearmint along \nwith some cumin. Other cargo already in the hold included over four hundert bottles o’ Jeman wine, and twelve \ndozen wizards flasks… we also had two score bags o’ good coffee, n the cap’n had negotiated our wages, and his, \nfor a small chest of the fabled black pearls from Oran. We were fully loaded, in good spirits, and a head’n fer \nhome…” \n \n“ Finally I called it a night n hung my hammock. I was awakened in the night by a loud crash as the Princess \nstruck the reef. We had been movin along at a full clip, and the hull was sheared open. Our momentum carried us \nclean o’er the reef. For a few minutes after, I thought we would make it as the sailors mannin’ the pumps reported \nthe water levels in the hold a goin down with the efforts of the mergency crew –n- all… Then the keel struck \nanother reef, and separated from the Princess. It twas all o’er just like that, the Princess capsized in seconds and \nsank. \n \nThe first mate Ivar, hangs his head. By his demeanor, you know not all the crew made it out alive that night… \n \n“She loved me though… The Princess let me go, she did… She gave me the last o’ her luck as well. In the \nmorning after we survivors made it ashore, The Cap’n called the remaining crew together… We were attacked \nafore noon by the first mate, Lithwyn. Some of our former crew attacked us as well, along within some locals, and \na wizard we had ne’er seen before. The Cap’n seriously wounded Lithwyn. I think he kilt the wizard as well, but \nthey almost a killed him too… Even now, he is not fully recovered, but he is pushin hard, to recover what the fates \nwill us, afore any others find out about the wreck o’ the Emerald Princess and scry out it’s location.” \n \n\n\n\nTimeline \nThe journey in the Torshayn will take a little over 3 days with fair weather and moderate winds. The ship will be \ntraveling in a Northeastern direction until the last day where it will then have to carefully maneuver to avoid the \nreefs (a DC15 sailing skill check while the ship is moving, every 4 hours by the ship’s captain) in the area of the \nshipwreck. On board the Torshayn are six sailors, the Captain of the Torshayn, Havuk Kharim, and two guards, \nDannal, and Garen Silvercross.  Of the original group, there is Captain Ari, The 1st Mate, Ivar, and four of the \noriginal crew of the Emerald Princess. In addition, all the players have come aboard the Torshayn in the predawn. \n\nNPC Stats \nAri, Captain of the Emerald Princess, 7th level fighter, Str-16 Int-10 Wis-12 Con-14 Dex-13 Chr-14  \nAC-22 HD-7 HP 28 (51) Init +5, Speed 20 ft. +2 Longsword  +9/+4 TH +4 Damage (1d8+2), crit 19-20 x2 \nslashing weapon.

Xp Value 1,800 \n\nJourney \n1st Day \nThe rain, heavy seas, and wind is gone now, replaced by a thick early morning fog that blankets the coastline. In \nthe predawn hours the Torshayn slips out to sea with only the ships’ bell, and the lapping of the gentle swells on \nthe hull breaking the morning quiet. \n\n\n\nWeather & Encounters Table \nRoll once to establish the weather after leaving port, Roll once every 6 hours thereafter for an encounter at sea… \n \n\nTable 1-1 Weather & Encounters Table \nRoll \n1d20 \n\nWeather Encounter Encounter Type \n\n1 Gale force, or worse, winds, mountainous \nseas, blinding rain, lightning.

Weather – Roll 1d20 with a result of 1-10 meaning the weather degrades one slot on the weather table, \nand worsens, and a result of 11-20 meaning the weather will improve a bit to the tune of 1 slot towards better \nsailing on this weather table. \n \nOnce the ship leaves the site of land all the players are required to make a DC11 roll versus fortitude to avoid \nseas-sickness. Also, if the weather degrades and there are 6’ or greater swells, the players will be required to make \nDC11 fortitude saves every six hours, as long as the weather is stormy, or become seasick. For every failed \nseasickness roll, the player will suffer a temporary loss of 1 Strength point. For every saving throw made, the \nplayer will regain 1 point of Strength. If the player makes 3 successful saves in a row, he or she becomes immune \nto seasickness, and need not roll again for seasickness when sailing. If a player ever reaches 0 Strength, he or she \nwill be incapacitated until landfall is made, and will thereafter never willingly put to sea on a boat or ship again. \n\n\n\nRecovery Operations \nOnce the Torshayn arrives in the area of the sunken Emerald Princess one of three things will be happening. All \nthings being equal, roll 1d20, with a result of 6 or less meaning that Lithwyn is already recovering goods from the \nwreck, 7-13 meaning Lithwyn is on the nearby island, and a 14 or more, The Torshayn has a 1 to 4 day lead on \nLithwyn (roll 1d20/5 and round up, or roll 1d4). \n \n1) If Lithwyn and his mutineers are already recovering loot from the wreck, their two-masted sloop, the Valantyn \nBreas will be anchored about fifty yards from the wreck. On board Valantyn Breas will be Lithwyn, a 6th level \nmarine, Argus Trego, a 5th level Rogue/Sailor, Mahmet Ilzar, a 5th level Wizard, and Mari Laurens, a 3rd level \nRogue, Nine 3rd level barbarian warriors recruited from the nearby islands, Five 2nd level barbarian warriors, and \nten 1st level barbarian warriors, all in for a share of the loot of the Emerald Princess. The party will need to figure \nout a way to either take the Valantyn Breas, or to drive the ship off, away from the wreck so recovery operations \ncan commence. If Lithwyn has already found the black pearls he’ll simply raise anchor and sail away abandoning \nthe remainder of the goods still sitting on the ocean floor. \n \n2) If Lithwyn and his mutineers are on the nearby Island, they will observe the Torshayn anchor in the vicinity of \nthe wreck. Using stealth, DC20 they will first approach in small boats, or by swimming, at night, and try to take \nthe Torshayn in a boarding action. The boats they use are simple dugouts that carry six people each. Watches on \nthe decks should have an opportunity to spot the dugouts DC25 as they slip towards the Torshayn, and especially \nif the players use warding or divination spells, otherwise, a fight for control of the Torshayn will commence \nshortly after sundown on the first day the players arrive. If they fail in this initial attack, and the principle \nMutineers survive, they will later attempt to sneak onboard the Torshayn DC20 and steal loot that is recovered in \nthe expedition.  \n \nIf the Torshayn arrives first, the players will have one, or more, days to commence recovery operations, and to \nprepare for the arrival of any other competing rivals. The wreck of the Emerald Princess lies on her side in about \n35 feet of water about 50 paces beyond the last coral reef they struck a month, or so, earlier. \n \nA preliminary dive will reveal the condition of the wreck. Any dive requires a DC15 swim skills check with \nfailure meaning the diver must immediately surface and make a DC10 swim check to avoid drowning. A six-foot \nsection of the forward keel beam is about 30 yards away from the wreck and the hull is torn wide open along the \nfront. The hull in the last few minutes acted as a water scoop. Water flooding the forward hull swept all loose \nbarrels, boxes, and crates to the back half of the cargo hold, and everything not tied down was then scattered again \nas the ship rolled over in her death throes. No bodies will be found, though some bones may litter the sea floor. \nThe ship is a mess and locating any specific type of cargo is subject to a DC 15 search check during the dive. The \nBlack pearls are located in a secret cache in the captain’s cabin, and a DC33 search is needed unless Captain Ari \ntells the players where the pearls are hidden. There is 9,754 Gp worth of black pearls in a small chest in the cache. \n \nDivers will be able to make multiple dives into the wreck every hour, with an average dive time of three minutes,  \n(time for one search) and an average resting time of five minutes between dives. After an hour, any given diver \nmust rest onboard for at least 2 hours before resuming diving. Night dives are only possible if the divers have \nunderwater light sources to dive with. Some of the crew will be standing by with pulleys on the masts to haul up \nheavy objects including barrels, boxes, and crates to the surface. A successful dive check must be made, and a \nsuccessful Use Ropes skills check DC12 must be made by the diver to affix a rope to any object to be lifted to the \nsurface. There is a 10% chance any object being hauled up will break open before reaching the surface (1d20 1-2). \n \nAfter a month on the ocean floor, the following cargo items are worthless: The fruit, the cedar boards, In barrels: \nthe butternuts, the pecans, the eggplant, the spearmint, and the cumin. The olive oil, and the bags of coffee are \nruined as well. However the clay vats and vases that contained the olive oil have a 75% chance of being intact \n(1d20 1-15), and are worth 2 coins for each recovered vase or vat. 120 vases & vats were on the ships manifest. \n \nEach box of longswords contains 20 well made swords, there is a 25% chance (1d20 1-5) that any box or crate has \nbroken apart and the goods are scattered within the hull, or on the ocean floor. The longswords are worth 15 Gp \neach.  There are three crates of armor as well, One crate of studded leather armor is ruined. There is a crate with \nfour masterworks breastplates worth 350 gold coins each, and the other box contains six chain shirts, that are \nworth 80 to 100 coins each. There are 4 crates of carpentry, and shoeing tools, worth 125 Gp each, all intact. \n\n\n\nThe wine is in cases of 24 bottles each. There are a total of 18 cases of wine in, and around, the wreck. There is a \n75% (Roll 1d20 1-15) chance that any given wine bottle is broke, or fractured, or has been contaminated with \nseawater. Each good bottle of wine will fetch 4 gold pieces on the open market. Of the wizards’ flasks, there are \n10 cases of 12 flasks each remaining to be found. There is also a 75% probability any given wizards flask is \nintact. Each flask recovered is worth approximately 1 gold coin. \n \nAdditional items of value that may be found and recovered include most of the sail canvas, rope, buckets, \ngrappling hooks, lanterns, a small selection of picks and shovels, The Captains’ spyglass (in his cabin) worth \n250Gp, The ships bell, the figurehead, several silver and /or gold holy symbols, a set of thieves tools, a navigators \nastrolabe and tools in a pouch, and a couple of coin pouches with 10-20 coins each in them and one or two gems. \n\nThe Mutineers \nLithwyn, 6th level Marine / Sailor Str-15 Int-12 Wis-6 Con-12 Dex-13 Chr-12  \nAC-16 HD-6 HP 32 Init +5, Speed 20 ft. +1 Cutlass +11/+6 TH +4 Damage (1d6+4), crit 18-20 x2 slashing \nweapon  (F/R/W +5/+2/+0) Alignment - NE \nSkills (Sr): Knowledge- Sailing (7), Swim (5), Knowledge – Sea Lore (4), Use Rope (4).

He has three primary personalities, “The Master Thief”, the “Pious Pilgrim”, and \n“Shadowlord”. He is quiet and kills people as the “Shadowlord”, he believes he is an assassin fulfilling the will of \nthe gods. The “Master Thief” is a professional all the way, and looks down on common thieves, he enjoys \nplanning and executing heists and burglaries. “Master Thief” is not religious, and is in fact, Immoral. When he is \na “Pious Pilgrim”, he believes the god of life has redeemed him, and that he must serve by converting other \nplayers and NPCs to follow the god of life. This usually involves talking other individuals and groups into taking \na vow against the god of death, and slaying followers of the Death God.

By adapting the monsters \nencountered, it can be modified for smaller or \nlarger parties of lower or higher levels. \n\nThe Tale of the Falcon Clan \nYears ago, the area of wilderness known as the \n\nWyvern's Claws was the territory of the Falcon \nClan, a tribe of nomadic herders and traders who, \ndespite the harsh environment in which they lived, \nmanaged to survive and thrive. Much of this \nsuccess was due to an alliance between them and a \njanni worshipper of Obad-Hai who lived in the \narea. An ancient ancestor of the Falcon Clan had \ncome to the janni's aid long before, and to repay \nthis service the genie granted them the use of his \noasis and temple. \n\n This arrangement proved quite \nadvantageous to the Falcon Clan; with a steady \nwater supply and the tacit blessing of Obad-Hai, \nthey were able to outlast times of drought and \nother hardship. The tribe flourished and grew, and \nMoustapha's temple was nearly always surrounded \nby nomad camps and the tents of passing \nmerchants. \n\n All this success naturally caused some \njealousy. A band of desert raiders, led by a \nsorcerer named Kamal, decided to strike the \nFalcon tribe's camp to steal their goods. The \nnomads defended their camp ferociously, and with \nmore than a little help from Moustapha repelled \nthe raiders. \n\n In the aftermath of his defeat, Kamal \nbegan to plot a new strategy. Realizing the \nimportance of the janni to the Falcon Clan's \nstrength, the sorcerer disguised himself and \nentered Moustapha's oasis garden, armed with a \nmagical trap. Once inside he bided time until he \nfound the janni alone, then sprang the trap and \nimprisoned the unsuspecting Moustapha. After \n\nescaping from the garden, Kamal led his brigands \nin a renewed attack. This time the Falcon Clan \nwas defeated. \n\n The sorcerer and his minions came to rule \nthe Wyvern's Claws, looting the merchants' goods \nand enslaving any nomads who weren't killed. \nThus began a reign of terror throughout this area \nof the wilderness, as no clan had the strength to \nthrow off the shackles of the bandits' tyranny. \n\nThe Janni Prison \nKamal's trap consists of a small box, four \n\ninches on a side, with circular indentations on four \nof its faces. These recesses held a collection of \nfour discs, each engraved with a rune for one of \nthe four elements. The discs provide the keys to \nthe prison; it can only be opened or closed when \nall four are in place. The placement of the discs is \nalso important--air must be placed opposite earth, \nand fire must be opposite water. \n\n After capturing Moustapha and defeating \nthe Falcon Clan, Kamal hid the discs throughout \nthe abandoned oasis. Moreover, he devised a \nnumber of traps and summoned a few monsters to \nguard the temple and the keys. Since then the tale \nof the Falcon Clan has fallen into obscurity, all \nbut forgotten. \n\nEnter the Player Characters \nThis adventure can begin at any time when the \n\nPC's have had an opportunity to acquire the \nprison. This could be at the end of another \nadventure, tucked in with additional treasures; \nalternately, the PC's might find it while perusing \nmerchants' goods at the bazaar. \n\n In any case, one of the PC's finds the \nprison, along with a scrap of parchment containing \nthe following message: \"Seek an answer in the \nClaws of the Wyvern.\" (The parchment is a note \nfrom a sage who researched the item for a former \nowner who soon after lost the cube.) On a DC 15 \nKnowledge: geography check, or perhaps with a \nsuccessful Bardic Lore check, the PC's can \nidentify the Wyvern's Claws as a formation of six \nrock spires located on the edge of the nearest \ndesert. Succeeding at this, the characters could \nalso recognize that the area was once the territory \n\n\n\n \n\n2 \n\nof an old nomad clan, but that it is now a lawless \narea controlled by roaming bands of brigands (DC \n18 Knowledge: history check). Should the PC's \nnot be able to recall such information, they could \nlearn it through a visit to the nearest sage. \n\n Armed with whatever information they \nmanage to acquire, and equipped for an overland \njourney, they can set out. The expedition can be \nlong and difficult or short and uneventful, at the \nDM's discretion. Should the DM wish to weave \nKamal and his band of brigands into the story, an \nearly encounter with a bandit patrol could be a \ngood opportunity to introduce that plot element. \nAt the end of the journey, the PC's find themselves \ngazing across the wilderness at an incongruous \nsight. \n\nThe Oasis and Temple \nNestled amongst the low hills stands a once \nproud building of clay brick, its formerly \nwhitewashed walls now peeling and cracked. \nThe building consists of a broad, round wall \nsurrounding a courtyard, with small domes \njutting from three sides. Two large, ironbound \ndoors stand in front, their surfaces showing the \ndamaging effects of weather and time. \n\n The doors are sealed tightly and locked. A \nDC 25 Open Locks check is needed to circumvent \nthe lock; failing this, a DC 23 Strength check can \nbust the door. As a last resort, treat the door as \nhaving Hardness 5 and 20 hit points. Scaling the \nwalls is also an option. Treat the wall as a rough \nsurface (DC 25). For purposes of climbing, it is \ntwenty feet high. \n\n1. The Garden (EL 5) \n\nIn stark contrast to the surrounding wilderness, \nthis broad courtyard is filled with lush plants \nand flowers. Further examination reveals, \nhowever, that what was once a carefully tended \ngarden has actually begun to grow wild. Once \nneatly arranged rows have become disorderly, \nand here and there patches of weeds have \ninfested the place. Indeed, more than a few \nplants have succumbed to lack of care and have \nwilted. \n\n Three curtained alcoves grant access to \nthe other parts of the building, there contents \n\nshrouded in shadow. In the center of the garden \nstands a stone well. \n\n The foliage of the garden conceals a pair \nof unpleasant surprises, two assassin vines planted \nby Kamal. These are located at the spots marked \n\"A\" on the map, and have a reach of up to 20 feet \nwith their vines. They attack as soon as any prey \ncomes with range. \n\n Assassin Vines (2): CR 3; SZ L plant; \nHD 4d8+12; hp 32, 28; Init +0; Spd 0 ft; AC \n15; Atk +7 melee (1d6+7 [x2], slam); \nFace/Reach 5 ft. by 5 ft./20 ft.; SA Improved \ngrab, entangle, constrict 1d6+7; SQ \nCamouflage, electricity immunity, cold and fire \nresistance 20, blindsight; AL N; SV Fort +7, \nRef +1, Will +2; Str 20, Dex 10, Con 16, Int --, \nWis 13, Cha 9. \n\nOnce the PC's have battled one of the \nvines, if they think to do so they can distinguish \nthe other on a DC 15 Search check. Searching \namongst the foliage around the vines can yield the \ntreasure lost by their past victims, amounting to \n124 sp, a 50-gp piece of amber and a dagger +1 \n(DC 18 Search for each). \n\n Amongst the foliage there is also the body \nof a hapless rogue, marked \"B\" on the map. Only \nbones and tattered clothing remain of the explorer. \nThis can serve as a warning to the PC's if they \nhave not yet encountered the assassin vines. \n\n2. Well (EL 3) \n\nThis is a deep, functional well; the air above it \nis cool and damp. Reflected light ripples on the \nsurface of the water twenty feet below, where \nthe sides of the shaft are slick and mossy. \n\n On a DC 8 Search check, characters \nexamining the well notice something golden \nglittering amongst what seems to be a pile of \nbones on its bottom. Unbeknownst to the PC's, \nthis is treasure dropped by the prey of the well \nspirit that resides here. Any character who \nventures within five feet of the well's mouth is \nimmediately attacked. \n\n Well Spirit: CR 3; SZ M undead; HD \n5d12; hp 37; Init +8; Spd 40 ft; AC 20; Atk \nnone; SA drown (DC 20 Fort save per round or \n\n\n\n \n\n3 \n\nlose 1d12 hp); SQ damage reduction, undead; \nAL NE; SV Fort +1, Ref +5, Will +3; Str 16, \nDex 19, Con --, Int 9, Wis 9, Cha 0. \n\n Skills: Listen +5, Spot +5. Feats: Improved \nInitiative. \n\n Climbing the well shaft is a relatively easy \nfeat, since the close walls provide for a chimney \neffect (total DC 10). This assumes, naturally, that \nthe well spirit has been dispatched. The water \nitself is 20 feet deep, so characters who wish to \ninspect the bottom must succeed at a DC 10 Swim \ncheck to make the dive. (Alternately, the PC's can \nuse rocks or some other weight to pull a character \ndown, releasing them once the inspection is \nfinished.) \n\n The treasure consists of 37 gp, a gold ring \n(100 gp, non-magical) and a crystal disc engraved \nwith the water rune. \n\n3. Shrine to Obad-Hai (EL 5) \nCharacters approaching within 30 feet of this \n\narea can notice on a DC 12 Spot check that the \ncurtain covering its entrance is charred at the \nedges and stained from smoke. \n\n Heats rolls out of this room in stifling \nwaves. Amidst a sea of ashes on the floor \nstands a life-sized statue that depicts an old, \nbearded man dressed like a hermit and carrying \na hornwood staff. Before this sits a large \nbrazier that still smolders with flame; a charred \nprayer mat lies amongst the ashes. \n\n On an easy Knowledge: religion check \n(DC 10) PC's can identify the statue as that of \nObad-Hai, god of nature. \n\n Assuming that the PC's are curious about \nthe still-burning brazier, they should investigate. \nThe ash on the floor has grown cold, but the \nbrazier is still hot. A pair of magmins who guard \nthe fire icon hidden inside attack unceasingly the \nfirst character who approaches. \n\n Magmin (2): CR 3; SZ S elemental \n(fire); HD 2d8; hp 10, 7; Init +1; Spd 30 ft; AC \n14; Atk +1 melee (1d8 [x2], fire); SA \ncombustion (DC 11 Reflex save or suffer 1d8 \ndamage for ad4+2 rounds), Fiery aura (DC 11 \nFort save or suffer 1d8 damage within 30 ft.); \n\nSQ elemental, fire subtype, melt weapons \n(weapons must Fort save (DC 11) or melt), \ndamage reduction 15/+1; AL CN; SV Fort +0, \nRef +4, Will +0; Str 9, Dex 13, Con 11, Int 8, \nWis 10, Cha 10. \n\n Skills: Climb +4, Escape Artist +5, Jump \n+4, Spot +4. \n\n Once they have been dispatched, \nrecovering the icon is still no easy task Anyone \nhandling the brazier before it has a time to cool \nsuffers 1d6 damage; should a character actually \nstick a hand into the coals, increase the damage to \n2d6. The PC's would be wise to dump its icons \nonto the floor, where they can be doused with \nwater or something similar to cool them. The fire \nicon is forged from burnt steel, embossed with the \nfire rune. \n\n4. Sleeping Quarters \n\nThis area seems quite mundane. A sleeping \ncushion rests against one wall; opposite this \nsits a large, padlocked chest. Against the wall \nbetween them stands a sealed wardrobe. \n\nThe wardrobe contains two sets of ordinary \ntraveler's clothing, along with a leather backpack \nand a non-magical staff. \n\n The chest is securely locked; a DC 20 \nOpen Locks check is needed to bypass it. \nOtherwise, it is hardness 15 and has 30 hit points. \nInside the chest is a sack containing 200 gp, a 100-\ngp pearl in a small box and a potion of endurance. \nLawful and good-aligned PC's should keep in \nmind that these items rightfully belong to \nMoustapha. \n\n Hidden beneath the sleeping cushion is \nthe key that unlocks the janni's journal (see \nbelow). \n\n5. Library \n\nA low table and seating cushion occupy the \ncenter of this room; atop the table sit an unlit \noil lamp and an open book. Opposite the door \nstands a bookshelf, containing a variety of \nsupplies, tomes and other items. \n\n\n\n \n\n4 \n\n The book on the table is a holy text of \nObad-Hai, detailing the beliefs and philosophies \nof his faith. The lamp is non-magical. \n\n Amongst the items on the shelf one can \nfind three vials of ink, a box of quills, a \nmagnifying glass and an hourglass. The books \ninclude a collection of tales written by desert \nbards, a text detailing plants unique to the climate \n(granting a +2 circumstance bonus to Wilderness \nLore and Knowledge: nature checks involving \ndesert flora), and a small book sealed with a brass \nbinding and a lock. This last item is Moustapha's \njournal a detailed description of his strategies for \ncultivating the garden over three years' time; it \nincludes such information as weather reports, \nnotations of water and fertilizer given, and the \nlike. \n\n On a DC 18 Search check, the PC's can \nfind a loose flagstone in the floor; a DC 10 \nStrength check is needed to remove the stone. \nBeneath, partially buried in the sand, is the ring \nhandle for the trapdoor that grants access to the \nchamber below. \n\n6. Underground Chamber (EL 6) \n\nThis is a small, square room carved from the \nearth. On a pedestal in the center of the room \nrests a small stone disc, carved with a rune. \n\n A pair of gargoyles wait in the two eastern \ncorners of the room, ready to attack anyone \nattempting to steal the icon. (The icon is a \npolished disc of jet engraved with the rune for \nearth.) Moreover, the sections of floor \nsurrounding the pedestal are trapped; whenever \nmore than twenty pounds of weight are put upon \nthem, extraordinarily fine sand begins to pour into \nthe room from the four corners of the ceiling. The \nsand pours in at a rate of one foot per round, \nbringing with a cumulative -2 penalty per round to \nhit. Once the sand becomes deeper than characters \nare tall, they must make Swim checks at a -2 \npenalty or suffer the effects of drowning. \n\n Gargoyles (2): CR 4; SZ M magical \nbeast (earth); HD 4d10 +16; hp 42; Init +2; \nSpd 45 ft, fly 75 ft; AC 16; Atk +6 melee (1d4 \n[x2], 2 claws), +4 melee (1d6 [x2], bite), +4 \nmelee (1d6 [x2] gore); SQ Damage reduction \n\n15/+1, freeze (DC 20 Spot check to recognize \nmotionless gargoyle); AL CE; SV Fort +8, Ref \n+6, Will +1; Str 11, Dex 14, Con 18, Int 6, Wis \n11, Cha 7. \n\n Skills: Hide +9, Listen +4, Spot +4. \nFeats: Multiattack, Weapon Finesse (claw, \nbite, gore). \n\n7. Hidden Room (EL 6) \nOnce the PC's have gathered the other icons, \n\nthey should be able to deduce a pattern: each icon \nis concealed within its own element. The question, \nof course, is how something can be hidden in thin \nair. \n\n The answer (and the icon) lies in a small \nextra-dimensional room hidden just inside and \nabove the front gate. An invisible door stands \nabout three feet from the walkway that runs along \nthe circumference of the temple wall. One way to \nfind the door is to walk along the wall, holding out \nsomething like a sword or staff into the air; as the \ncharacter passes the front gate, the implement \nthuds against the invisible door. Pitching stones \nthrough the air is another option, although it has \nonly a 5% chance per stone of succeeding. \n\nWhen the PC's find the door, it can be \nopened: \n\nWith a pull the door gives way, revealing a \ndoorway seemingly cut from thin air. \nImmediately as it opens, thick clouds of smoke \ncome roiling out. Moments pass, but they don't \nseem to abate. \n\n The smoke is the product of an \neversmoking bottle left inside the room. While it \nmakes breathing difficult and seeing virtually \nimpossible (characters are blinded and must hold \ntheir breath), it is merely a screen that conceals \nthe air icon and its guardian, a belker. The belker, \nhaving been imprisoned for a very long time, \nattacks in a rage. \n\n Belker: CR 6; SZ L elemental (air); HD \n7d8+7; hp 43; Init +5; Spd 30 ft, fly 50 ft; AC \n22; Atk +9 melee (1d6+2 [x2], 2 wings), +4 \nmelee (1d4+1 [x2], bite), +4 melee (1d3+1 \n[x2], 2 claws); Face/Reach 5 ft by 5 ft/10 ft; \nSA smoke claws (DC 14 Fort save per round or \n\n\n\n \n\n5 \n\nsuffer 3d4 damage); SQ smoke form (as per \ngaseous form; AL NE; SV Fort +3, Ref +10, \nWill +2; Str 14, Dex 21, Con 13, Int 6, Wis 11, \nCha 11. \n\n Skills: Listen +9, Move Silently +9, Spot \n+9. Feats: Multiattack, Weapon Finesse \n(wing). \n\n On the floor in the middle of the far wall \nsits the eversmoking bottle; its stopper must be \nsealed, at which point the smoke clears after ten \nrounds. Unless this is done, the air icon--which \nhangs on a three-foot cord from the middle of the \nceiling--proves quite difficult to find. This icon is \nmade from polished sandalwood, cut with the air \nrune. \n\nAssembling the Prison \nWhen the last icon is attached to the \n\nprison, the PC's witness the following: \n\nAs the last key clicks into place, the box begins \nto glow with a magical light. Slowly the \nillumination grows in intensity, until it \nbecomes blindingly brilliant. Finally it flares, \nand then winks out. In its aftermath, you find a \nnoble-looking desert nomad standing in your \nmidst. \n\n The newcomer is obviously Moustapha. \nThe janni is extraordinarily grateful for his \nrelease, thanking the PC's effusively and \ncomplimenting them on their bravery, intelligence, \nprowess at arms, sense of honor, wisdom, etc. As \na reward he offers the treasure from the chest in \nhis room, and even forgives the PC's if they have \nalready pocketed said goods. Furthermore, he \nproduces the one item that he kept on his person, a \nportable hole. He also makes his rescuers a \npromise: should they ever require his assistance in \nthe future, the adventurers can call upon him for \naid. \n\n As one last item of business, Moustapha \nasks for the device that once held him prisoner. If \nhe is given it, the janni uses his enlarge ability to \nbecome 24 feet tall, the draws his newly enlarged \ndagger and strikes the cube with a destructive \nblow. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFurther Adventures \nIf the DM so desires, the adventure can end \n\nhere with the party's successful release of the \njanni. There are, however, other options. \n\n For one there is the sorcerer, who could \nstill be alive. In this case, he might take notice of \nthe Player Characters' actions; the plume of smoke \nrising out of the hidden room should be noticeable \nfor miles around in the wilderness. Seeing this, he \nand his band of raiders might come to confront the \nthreat that the PC's represent. \n\n Alternately, dealing with the brigands \nmight become a quest for the PC's; perhaps, with \nMoustapha serving as their advisor, they could \ntrack the raiding parties, scout out their lair, seek \nout and unite the disbanded Falcon Clan, and then \nlead a campaign to once and for all end the terror \nthat the evildoers have brought upon the land. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nThe d20 System® License version 1.0 \n\n1.

Jones <>\n\nLast updated 7 September, 2001: fixed some discrepancies in skills, etc., and some monster stats; fixed some formatting problems and updated links to variant ranger class. \nFirst submitted: 29 April, 2001\n\nSummary of Conversion: This module has been re-scaled to 3E for any four characters of 2nd level (the original is slated for 4-7 characters of 1st to 3rd level, so very little change was required). NPCs, creatures, and encounters have been modified in levels or in number to accommodate this challenge rating. But the DM can easily alter the number and/or toughness of monsters to suit their players’ group’s needs. As well, I have altered (read: reduced) treasures to 3E standards and have often turned them into what I hope are more believable and/or interesting forms. Other incidental details or explanations do appear throughout  of course, feel free to adjust or dismiss anything that doesn’t work in your campaign.\n\n\n\nThe Village of Orlane\nOrlane (hamlet): Conventional/Monstrous; AL NG (NE); 140-gp limit*; Assets 730 gp; Population 104 (was once nearly 300); Very isolated (human 98%, elf 2%).\nAuthority Figures: Zakarias Ormond, male human War3 (mayor); Abramo, male human Clr7 (priest, cult member); Grover Ruskadel, male human Ftr2 (constable, cult member).  \nImportant Characters: Snigrot Dogroot, male human Rog3 (cult leader); Bertram Beswill, male human Com3 (innkeeper, Golden Grain Inn, cult member); Misha Devi, female human Clr3 (priestess, cult member); Derek Desleigh, male human Rog3/Ftr1 (false cult member); Ramne, male human Wiz7 (hermit); Dorian, male elf Wiz3/Ftr1 (spy); Llywillan, male elf Rog2/Ftr1 (spy); Alan Clayborn, male human Rgr4 (retired adventurer); Marieke Clayborn, female human Ftr3 (retired adventurer);  Traver Stoutheart, male human Ftr5 (mayor’s bodyguard); Belba Cralloon, female human Com2 (innkeeper, Inn of the Slumbering Serpent).\nOthers: (see numbered encounters for Orlane).\nNotes: Orlane is fully detailed below. * I have raised the GP limit for the village to slightly above standard because it is supposed to have been a very rich farming community.\n\n\nThe Key to Orlane\n\nUnless otherwise noted, villagers are average neutral good level 1 human commoners; those who are cult members are still generally neutral or neutral good, but have been charmed and therefore may act like they are neutral evil. Hit points are listed along with any other pertinent information in parentheses after the NPC’s name/description where appropriate  if none are listed, that NPC is a non-combatant. \n\tGenerally, any PCs speaking with cult members may make a successful Sense Motive check (DC 25) to notice that that villager’s behaviour is unusual  i.e., that they have been charmed. \nMuch, if not most of the work done among the villagers would be paid for primarily in trade, as opposed to in money  or at least would have been done so before cult activity segregated and alienated the inhabitants. \n\tFor this reason, the amount of treasure found in villagers’ homes has been greatly reduced. This is happily in keeping with the 3E town-building guidelines: as noted above, the entire village has only about 730 gp in total assets [though I have not included in this total any treasures found with monsters or foreigners, i.e., where I have assigned an EL for the encounter]. \n\n\nPleasant Farmhouse and Barn\nThe farmer Hewitt Twaine (Com2; hp 5; Spot +2) and his wife Lynne live here with their two grown sons (hp 4) and teenage daughter. A Search check (DC 17) is required to find the loose floorboard in the Twaines’ bedroom, which conceals the treasure. \nTreasure: A small sack holds the Twaines’ savings: a well-polished silver cup, given to the couple at their wedding (70 sp), and a pouch holding 23 sp. Lynne wears a copper wedding band worth 15 cp. \n\n\nConstable’s Quarters\nCult members! Note that Grover will do most or all of the talking, so Sense Motive checks to discern charm can only be made with respect to him. If PCs do successfully sense the fact that he has been charmed, and then react noticeably to this knowledge or comment on it, he will quickly deny it and try to alleviate their suspicions; if they pursue it or seem about to do something rash, he is likely to become hostile. If it becomes necessary due to the PCs’ asking too many questions, all three will try to intimidate the PCs or force them to leave town.\nConstable Grover Ruskadel, male human Ftr2: CR 2; SZ Medium; HD 2d10+4; hp 14; Init +2 (Dex); Spd 20 ft in armour (run x3); AC 18 (+1 Dex, +6 banded mail, +1 shield); Atk +5 melee (1d8+2, 19-20/x2, longsword), or +4 ranged (1d8, 19-20/x2, 80 ft, light crossbow); SV Fort +5, Ref +2, Will -1; AL N; Str 15, Dex 14, Con 15, Int 7, Wis 9, Cha 10. \nSkills: Handle Animal +1, Spot +1.

A Search check (DC 16) is required to find the treasure hidden in a milk can in the barn. \nTreasure: 15 sp and 72 cp.\n\n\nWeaver’s House and Shop\nGalen Weaver and his wife Helena (Sense Motive +2, Listen +2) live here. A successful Gather Information check (DC 12) is required to prompt Galen’s warning regarding the Golden Grain Inn. They own nothing of any great value. \n\n\nGolden Grain Inn\nSee the full, numbered description of this location below, following The Key to Orlane.\n\n\nJeweller and Moneychanger\n* Note: As mentioned at the beginning of this conversion of Orlane, there are limited resources in the village  Haskali the Moneychanger does not have hidden chests under the floor in his home full of a king’s ransom, as in the module. [Though PCs might hear such a thing as a wild rumour, and the roguish ones may decide to investigate].\n\tHaskali Ull (Com2; hp 3; Appraise +6, Craft (gemcutting) +5, Craft (whitesmithing) +5, Diplomacy +3), the soft-spoken jeweller and moneychanger of Orlane, will always try to get a fair price for his work, and generally charges a 5% fee for exchanging currencies. His wife, Manala (Com2; hp 8; Str 16, Con 14; club +4 melee (1d6+3)), is quite an overbearing figure. One of the two guards, Wylie, is a cult member: Haskali wears the key to his strongbox on a string around his neck. \nErrol Rocklyn, male human War2: CR 1; SZ Medium; HD 2d8+6; hp 16; Init +1 (Dex); Spd 30 ft.; AC 13 (+1 Dex, +2 leather); Atk +5 melee (1d8+2, 19-20/x2, longsword); SV Fort +6, Ref +1, Will -1; AL NG; Str 15, Dex 13, Con 17, Int 12, Wis 9, Cha 12. \nSkills: Intimidate +3, Jump +6, Listen +3, Search +2, Spot +3.

Feats: Alertness, Dodge, Weapon Finesse (shortsword).\nPossessions: leather armour, shortsword, 11 sp.\nTreasure: In a metal strongbox in Haskali’s office [Hardness 10, hp 25; Break DC 25; Open Locks DC 30] are 5 pp, 25 gp, 50 sp, 250 cp, and 8 small ornamental stones (4d4 gp each). He also has four pieces of his handiwork for sale: a heavy gold ring (20 gp); a fine, silver-hilted dagger (30 gp); an ivory comb with silver inlays (35 gp); and his masterpiece, a lovely silver pendant with a small inset chrysoprase (95 gp). \n\n\nLivery Stable\nThe liveryman, Kilian Glade (hp 5; Listen +4, Spot +4), his wife Bette (Spot +3), and their three young sons live here. A successful Diplomacy check (DC 12) or Gather Information check (DC 15) will prompt him to tell what he knows (i.e., suspects) of the two strangers across the road (the elves in 9) and of his apprehensions concerning the Golden Grain Inn. Instead, he will recommend the Slumbering Serpent. After an hour of conversation, or if an initial Diplomacy check (DC 20) is successful, he will tell of the mysterious disappearance of the owners of the general store (12). \n\tIn the stables are 4 light horses and 2 heavy horses, 3 mules, 2 field oxen, and two small wagons; all are well used, but in good condition. He can likely be persuaded to sell a couple of horses or the mules, but only if he can get a decent price (at least 90% of that in the PHB, though he will likely throw in saddles, etc., to make the deal sweeter). \nLight horses: CR 1; SZ Large animal; HD 3d8+6; hp 19; Init +1; Spd 60 ft.; AC 13 (-1 size, +1 Dex, +3 natural); Atk 2 hooves +2 melee (1d4+1); Face 5 ft x 10 ft; SQ scent; AL N; SV Fort +5, Ref +4, Will +2; Str 13, Dex 13, Con 15, Int 2, Wis 12, Chr 6.  \nSkills: Listen +6, Spot +6.\nHeavy horses: CR 1; SZ Large animal; HD 3d8+6; hp 19; Init +1; Spd 50 ft.; AC 13 (-1 size, +1 Dex, +3 natural); Atk 2 hooves +3 melee (1d6+2); Face 5 ft x 10 ft; SQ scent; AL N; SV Fort +5, Ref +4, Will +2; Str 15, Dex 13, Con 15, Int 2, Wis 12, Chr 6.  \nSkills: Listen +6, Spot +6.\nSQ – Scent (Ex): Detects opponents by scent within 30 feet — 60 feet if opponent is upwind, and 15 feet if downwind (double these ranges if odour is strong; triple if overpowering).  \nMules: CR 1; SZ Large animal; HD 3d8+9; hp 22; Init +1; Spd 30 ft.; AC 13 (-1 size, +1 Dex, +3 natural); Atk 2 hooves +4 melee (1d4+3); Face 5 ft x 10 ft; AL N; SV Fort +6, Ref +4, Will +1; Str 16, Dex 13, Con 17, Int 2, Wis 11, Chr 6.  \nSkills: Listen +6, Spot +6.\nOxen (from bison stats): CR 1; SZ Large animal; HD 5d8+15; hp 37; Init +0; Spd 40 ft.; AC 12 (-1 size, +3 natural); Atk butt +6 melee (1d8+10); Face 5 ft x 10 ft; SQ scent; AL N; SV Fort +7, Ref +4, Will +1; Str 18, Dex 10, Con 16, Int 2, Wis 11, Chr 4.  \nSkills: Listen +8, Spot +5.\nSQ – Scent (Ex): Detects opponents by scent within 30 feet — 60 feet if opponent is upwind, and 15 feet if downwind (double these ranges if odour is strong; triple if overpowering).  \nTreasure: A Search check (DC 20) is required to find the Glades’ considerable life savings, buried in a box in the stable: 4 gold coins, an old ivory drinking horn with gold etching (15 gp, far too valuable to be kept in the house), 37 sp, and 40 cp.\n\n\nSmall Cottage\nThe two elves here are using aliases and disguises to cover their elven identities: Dorian is actually named Fan Arfanodel and Llywillan is Iliavin, called Coldblossom. On the rare occasions when they go out in public, Dorian uses change self and Llywillan uses Disguise to appear human.

The box is well-locked and trapped with a sleep-gas concocted by Dorian, and is quite sturdy [Hardness 10; hp 10; Break DC 24; Open Locks DC 30]. Llywillan keeps the key (which bypasses the trap if used) in the bottom of his quiver. Note that a successful Open Locks will also bypass the trap, but if the roll is failed the trap is triggered; breaking or smashing the box will also trigger the trap, but only in a 10 ft x 10 ft area. \nSleep gas trap: CR 1; no attack roll required; Will save (DC 14) negates; Search DC 26; Disable Device DC 21. Note: This trap does no harm to the PCs directly, but fills the cottage with a fine mist that acts as a sleep spell. The gas dissipates quickly, and will operate only in the round it is first released. \nTreasure: The strongbox holds 50 gp, 50 sp, and the letter from the mayor. \n\n\nMayor’s Residence\nMayor Zakarias Ormond, a retired army officer, lives here with his cheerful wife and their two daughters and two older sons. He is sharp and observant and is thus well aware of the strange disappearances and behaviour of townsfolk, but is convinced that the problem is the old hermit at the edge of town (Ramne, at 27). Also in the house is Zakarias’ faithful old bodyguard, a fellow army vet, Traver Stoutheart.\nZakarias Ormond, male human War3: CR 2; SZ Medium; HD 3d8+3; hp 19; Init +0; Spd 30 ft, 20 ft in armour; AC 10, or 18 in armour (+5 chainmail, +3 shield); Atk +6 melee (1d3+3§, unarmed) or +8 melee (1d8+4, 19-20/x2, +1 longsword); SV Fort +4, Ref +1, Will +3; AL NG; Str 16, Dex 10, Con 12, Int 14, Wis 15, Cha 14. \nSkills: Craft (carpentry) +4, Diplomacy +7, Gather Information +3, Handle Animal +3, Innuendo +3, Knowledge (local) +7, Listen +3, Ride +5, Sense Motive +3.

Feats: Alertness, Improved Bull Rush, Improved Unarmed Strike, Power Attack, Weapon Focus (longsword), Weapon Specialization (longsword). \nPossessions: banded mail, large steel shield, +2 longsword.\nTreasure: The mayor and his wife own many small, slightly valuable pieces of bric-a-brac gathered in his travels and fine furnishings he built himself: in all, there is about 70 gp worth of ornaments, fine dinnerware, and beautiful furniture in their home. However, he also keeps some treasure in a small brass-bound chest [Hardness 5; hp 10; Break DC 21; Open Locks DC 30] hidden under the floor in his woodworking shop, found with a successful Search (DC 18). The key to the chest is hidden in a secret pocket inside his tunic (Search DC 15  and of course he is not likely to stand still while someone searches him). In the chest are what remains from Zak’s soldiering days: 44 gp, 270 sp, and two small gems (25 gp each). \n\n\nTailor Shop\nMyron Tweed (hp 3; Profession (tailor) +5, Sense Motive +3, Spot +3) is a very nervous old man. In a bundle of old clothes in the back of his home (Search DC 15) is a small sack holding his life savings.\nTreasure: 13 sp, 59 cp.\n\n\nVillage General Store\nCult members! Alec Finla and his three grown sons are all former members of the town militia, and Alec’s wife, Dina (hp 3; light crossbow +0 (1d8)), is also trained in the use of a crossbow. They keep a crossbow and 12 bolts under the counter in the store for use in emergencies, and the sons will be armed further as described in the module. \nAlec and sons, male human War1: CR ½; SZ Medium; HD 1d8; hp 7, 6, 5 (x2); Init +0; Spd 30 ft; AC 10, or 12 in armour (+2 leather); Atk +1 melee (1d3§, unarmed), +2 melee (1d6, 19-20/x2, shortsword), or +2 ranged (1d8, 19-20/x2, 80 ft, light crossbow); SV Fort +2, Ref +0, Will +0; AL N; Str 11, Dex 10, Con 11, Int 10, Wis 10, Cha 10. \nSkills: Appraise +1, Handle Animal +1, Knowledge (local) +1, Spot +3. Feats: Weapon Focus (light crossbow), Weapon Focus (shortsword). \nPossessions: leather armour, shortsword, light crossbow, 12 bolts.\nTreasure: In the store’s strongbox [Hardness 8; hp 15; Break DC 23; Open Locks DC 25] are 20 sp and 30 cp. Any larger amounts of change needing to be made will require PCs to visit the moneychanger. The two strongbox keys are worn on cords around Alec’s and Dina’s necks, respectively. \n\tHidden in a closet in the Finlas’ bedroom (Search DC 14) is a small, trapped chest [Hardness 5; hp 2; Break DC 18; Open Locks DC 25], the key to which is hidden under their mattress (Search DC 12). The chest is empty, but for some old clothes. \nPoison needle trap: CR 2; +6 ranged (1d2 and bloodroot poison (see DMG 80))  Fort DC 12, initial 0 / secondary 1d4 Con + 1d3 Wis; Search DC 20; Disable Device DC 20. Note: 10-ft. max range. \n\n\nRundown Farmhouse\nCult members! Gilliam Carver and his son Brent (hp 6, 5; club +0 melee (1d6)) have nothing of value, having given all to the cult. \n\n\nCarpenter’s Shop\nCult members! Philip Highstead (hp 3; Craft (carpentry) +6, Knowledge (engineering) +3) and his wife Trudi (hp 3; Spot +3; longsword +0 melee (1d8 and snake venom  Fort DC 10, initial and secondary 1d6 Con)) malinger here, listless and preoccupied. \nTreasure: Hidden behind the secret panel (Search DC 20) is Philip’s cunningly crafted wooden box. It is worth at least 40 gp to the right buyer and requires a successful Open Locks (DC 30) to open. However, it is quite fragile [Hardness 4; hp 1; Break DC 11] and holds no treasure  they have donated almost everything to the cult. \n\n\nBlacksmith’s Shop\nCult members! The massive and brutish Cull Smith and his two sons are all hardened former militia-men, while Cull’s wife Gail and their daughter are, perhaps understandably, meek and subservient. As described in the module (p.7-8), there is a good chance that Cull will fly into an extravagant rage. \nCull, male human Com1/War1: CR 1; SZ Medium; HD 1d4+1+1d8+1; hp 10; Init +0; Spd 30 ft; AC 11 (+1 leather apron); Atk +5 melee (1d3+4§, unarmed) or +6 melee (1d6+4, x2, hammer); SV Fort +3, Ref +0, Will -1; AL N; Str 18, Dex 10, Con 13, Int 10, Wis 9, Cha 5. \nSkills: Appraise +1, Craft (blacksmithing) +7, Handle Animal +3, Knowledge (local) +1, Listen +1.

Feats: Toughness, Weapon Focus (shortsword). \nPossessions: heavy leather apron, shortsword.\n\n\nBattered and Weatherbeaten Structure (EL 2)\nThe door to the former Foaming Mug Inn is stoutly barred: Hardness 5; hp 12; Break DC 23. There is a secret door on the back wall (Search DC 20). The staircase leading to the cellar is old and creaky, imposing a –5 circumstance penalty on all Move Silently attempts. Be sure to have the troglodytes roll to hear any PCs trying to sneak around in the building or downstairs. If the PCs have a light source, the trogs will see it through the cracks in the tool-room door and hide, waiting to ambush them. Allow any characters to make a Wisdom check (DC 10) to notice the stench  gnomes gain their +2 racial bonus to smell, as usual. \n\t* Note that the cellar is dank and dark enough to qualify as a subterranean setting, thus making the trogs’ Hide skill +10. \nTroglodytes (3): CR 1; Medium-size humanoid (reptilian); HD 2d8+4; hp 13; Init -1; Spd 30 ft; AC 15 (-1 Dex, +6 natural); Atk +1 melee (1d6, x3, stone handaxe) or 2 claws +1 melee (1d4), bite -1 melee (1d4); SA stench; SQ darkvision 90 ft; AL CE; SV Fort +5, Ref -1, Will +0; Str 10, Dex 9, Con 14, Int 8, Wis 10, Chr 10.  \nSkills: Hide +6*, Listen +3. Feats: Multiattack, Weapon Focus (handaxe).\nSA – Stench (Ex): When a trog is angry or frightened, it secretes an oily, musklike chemical that nearly every other form of animal life finds offensive. All creatures (except troglodytes) must succeed at a Fort save (DC 13) or be overcome with nausea: this lasts for 10 rounds and effectively deals 1d6 temporary Strength damage. \nSkills: A trog’s skin changes colours much like a chameleon, giving it a +4 racial bonus to Hide. *In rocky or subterranean settings, this bonus improves to +8. \nTreasure: The trogs have hidden a small sack in an old crate (Search DC 14). It contains much of the treasure recently collected by cult members to take back to Explictica’s lair: 4 gp, 89 sp, 130 cp, five semi-precious stones (35 gp each), an ornamental copper comb (10 gp), an engraved silver hand-mirror (45 gp), and a 12-piece set of slightly tarnished silverware (24 gp). \n\n\nDecrepit Farmhouse and Collapsed Barn\nUnder the rear porch steps (Search DC 18) is a leather satchel holding a set of masterwork carpentry tools.\n\n\nFarmhouse and Barn\nCult members! Mavis McMahon (Listen +3, Spot +3) and her three sons are all active members of the cult: she reports to the clerics both what she sees and hears and also what her sons find in their snooping and dragooning expeditions. \nDale, Gene, and Evan, male human Exp1: CR ½; SZ Medium; HD 1d6; hp 5, 4, 3; Init +0; Spd 30 ft; AC 10; Atk +0 melee (1d3§, unarmed), +0 melee (1d6§, sap), or +0 melee (1d6, club); SV Fort +0, Ref +0, Will +2; AL N; Str 10, Dex 11, Con 10, Int 10, Wis 10, Cha 10. \nSkills: Bluff +3, Gather Information +3, Handle Animal +3, Hide +4, Knowledge (local) +1, Listen +4, Move Silently +6, Spot +3, Use Rope +3. Feats: Martial Weapon (sap), Skill Focus (Move Silently). \nPossessions: sap, club.\n\n\nFarmhouse with Several Small Outbuildings\nDavid Grubb (Com2; hp 6; light crossbow +1 ranged (1d8)) and his wife Emm (hp 3; shortspear +0 melee (1d8)) live here with their teenage son, Tyler (hp 2; light crossbow +0 ranged (1d8)). \nTreasure: In a small wooden box concealed in the chicken feed (Search DC 17) are 11 sp and 35 cp. \n\n\nSmall, Neatly Kept Cottage\nElderly Vilma Merredie (Com2; Knowledge (local) +5; Listen +4; Spot +6) can tell PCs much of what has gone on in Orlane, both recently and in the past 50 years. But she is under some misconceptions, particularly about the Grubbs (at 19) and the two strangers (the elves at 9). Gather Information and, to some extent, Diplomacy checks will get information out of her as shown on the following table; a higher DC result gaining all lower results as well. In all cases, the PCs glean the information from among her various ramblings about the old days.\nGather\nInformationDiplomacyResulting Information1214She recommends the Inn of the Slumbering Serpent. She has a high opinion of the mayor. She has never liked the widow McMahon or her sons (who live at 18). The smith has always been an ill-tempered lout, but lately there’s just no talking to the man.1519She worries that the two strangers who moved into the cottage next door to the mayor may bring him harm. She has strong suspicions about the carpenter and the Eddings (at 22). The people across the road (19) used to be real nice, but now they act suspicious toward everyone, including me! The widow McMahon’s sons often go out at all hours. 1824She no longer allows anyone from Merikka’s Temple to call on her, as they have changed since they went away suddenly for a week about a year ago.20She has seen scaly humanoids with fin-like crests on their heads crossing north of her cottage and scaling the walls of the temple. Note that Merikka’s curse on anyone who harms or steals from Vilma imposes a –2 divine penalty on all rolls for a period of three days, and that this curse affects all companions of the offender as well. \nTreasure: The widow Merridie has a great deal of jewellery, most of which is not particularly valuable (though certainly she is rich by commoners’ standards): she wears several rings on each hand (30 sp total) and has a great deal more chains, pendants, charms, etc., in an unlocked case in her bedroom; as well, she has numerous knick-knacks and trifles scattered throughout her home. In all, these things are worth about another 15 gp total, not including one bracelet in the case which is actually quite valuable (50 gp), although she does not realize its value: it is made of silver and is crafted in the form of two twining eels with tiny green stones for eyes. Also, hidden in an old cookie jar in the kitchen (Search DC 15) are 8 sp and 24 cp. \n\n\nTemple of Merikka\nSee the full, numbered description of this location below, following The Key to Orlane.\n\n\nShabby Farm House\nCult members! Malcolm Eddings (hp 6), his wife Jenna, their teenage son, Tad (hp 5), their adult daughter, Maive, her husband, Bartholomew (hp 4), and the younger couple’s small boy, Malcolm all live here together. Because of the family’s post-charm confusion, any PC making a successful Gather Information check (DC 15) will catch one of them in a slip involving some mention of the cult in Orlane (the DM should decide what this slip might be, based on what/how much he or she wants the players to find out). \n\n\nProsperous Farmhouse and Barn\nSee variant ranger class at .  A simple matter to fix it if you disagree with this house rule. \nAll of Alan’s and Marieke’s adventuring gear and treasure is kept in a secret closet in their house which can be found only with a successful Search check (DC 24). Both of them have copies of the key to the strongbox [Hardness 7; hp 10; Break DC 22; Open Locks DC 25] therein. They have three children. \nNote: Alan does not make any secret ranger signs as described in the module, since, in 3E, rangers can be evil; thus, being a ranger is no guarantee of one’s moral or ethical character. The PCs will simply have to prove themselves to Alan and his wife by practical means  acts, not words  before they will be taken into confidence (DM’s discretion). [Alternately, one could give him Innuendo skill, but since most rangers do not develop this skill, there is no reason to expect the PC to have it  thus, Alan’s innuendo is not likely to be construed. On the other hand, his innuendo could be aimed simply at fellow do-gooders, and not necessarily rangers.]\nAlan Clayborn, male human Rgr4: CR 4; SZ Medium; HD 4d10+8; hp 33; Init +1; Spd 30 ft.; AC 11, 18 in armour (+1 Dex, +5 chain shirt, +2 shield); Atk +7 melee (1d3+3§, unarmed), +10 melee (1d8+5, 19-20/x2, +2 longsword), or +5* ranged (1d8+3*, x3, composite longbow); SA favoured enemy +1 (reptilian Humanoids), favoured terrain +1 (plains); SQ alertness, endurance; SV Fort +6, Ref +2, Will +3; AL NG; Str 17, Dex 12, Con 15, Int 13, Wis 15, Cha 12. \nSkills: Animal Empathy +5, Hide +4(5), Heal +6, Intuit Direction +3, Listen +7, Move Silently +4(5), Profession (farmer) +6, Ride +4, Search +4, Spot +7, Wilderness Lore +9.

He will not willingly give the PCs any information about the village or its inhabitants. Hidden in a hollow under an old mill wheel on the cellar floor (Search DC 20) is Miller’s locked chest [Hardness 5; hp 15; Break DC 23; Open Locks DC 25]; he keeps the key on him at all times. \nTreasure: Inside the chest are 52 sp and 66 cp. Recently, given the other villagers’ behaviour, the Millers have put their two gold wedding bands (4 gp each) in the chest for safekeeping, as well. \n\n\nGrove of Stately Elms\n* Note that the spells I have placed in Ramne’s (travelling) spellbook are mostly of use in protecting himself, or of minor use otherwise, so he should not further unbalance the game if he accompanies the PCs on their journey to the cult lair. The only possible exception to this is Leomund’s secure shelter, but I thought it a fitting spell  he certainly wouldn’t want to roll up in a blanket in a hedge when he has to travel... Still, DMs may find that this will hamper many random encounters on the way to the cult lair, and so should feel free to substitute another spell (perhaps fire shield). \n\tHe will never take his standard spellbook on a journey, but will leave it in his hut; all of its pages are covered by secret page to make it seem like a cookbook, and he will cast an Extended Nystul’s undetectable aura on it the night before leaving. The interior of the cottage is lit by candles with continual flame cast upon them; these can be hooded.

The drug has an onset time of 2d6 minutes, after which time any character who drank the drugged wine is considered shaken, though the –2 is a competence penalty rather than morale in this instance. Further, the character must then also make a Fortitude save (DC 14) or take initial damage of 1d6 points of temporary Dex; one minute later, the character must save again or fall unconscious for 1d6+4 hours. \n\tThe costs of food and drink are from 150% to 200% of those listed in the PHB, yet are all of substandard quality. \nBertram Beswill, male human Com3: CR 1; SZ Medium; HD 3d4; hp 8; Init +0; Spd 30 ft; AC 10; Atk +2 melee (1d3+1§, unarmed), +3 melee (1d4+1, 19-20/x2, dagger), or +2 melee (1d8+1, 19-20/x2, longsword); SV Fort +1, Ref +1, Will +1; AL N; Str 13, Dex 10, Con 11, Int 10, Wis 11, Cha 10. \nSkills: Appraise +1, Knowledge (local) +2, Listen +3, Profession (innkeeper) +6, Profession (cook) +4, Spot +1.

He dreams of becoming an infamous and feared assassin, but is, quite simply, a coward. He will never attack PCs unless he feels secure in doing so, relying on numbers of cult members to win the day. If the worse should happen despite his efforts, he will not hesitate to flee. \nSnigrot Dogroot, male human Rog3: CR 3; SZ Medium; HD 3d6; hp 11; Init +2; Spd 30 ft; AC 12 (+2 Dex); Atk +5 melee (1d4+1, 19-20/x2, +1 dagger); SA sneak attack +2d6, evasion, uncanny dodge; AL NE; SV Fort +1, Ref +5, Will +0; Str 10, Dex 15, Con 11, Int 12, Wis 8, Chr 5.\nSkills: Alchemy +6, Appraise +5, Disable Device +8, Disguise +3, Hide +8, Listen +5, Move Silently +8, Profession (cook) +1, Search +7, Spot +5, Use Rope +8.

Otherwise, the door stands open.\n\n\n Bertram’s Bedroom\nThere is a secret trapdoor in the floor concealed under one of the rugs (it opens onto a ladder down to room 18); a Search check (DC 15) is required to find it, though any character looking specifically under the rugs has to beat a DC of only 5. \n\tThe large chest [Hardness 5; hp 15; Break DC 23; Open Locks DC 25] is trapped with a magical slow-gas trap. The key to the chest is very cunningly hidden in a niche carved into the under-frame of the bed  Search DC 24). The trap will activate only if the chest is opened without the key. \nSlow gas trap: CR 3; no attack roll or damage (see below); Search DC 20; Disable Device DC 25. Note: This trap was made for Bertram years ago by an eccentric travelling wizard who was impressed with the innkeeper’s hospitality. The gas will dissipate after 1 round, but when released it affects all within the room as a slow spell cast by a 8th-level wizard, affecting those closest to the chest first. \nTreasure: In the chest are Bertram’s clothes and clean aprons and, underneath, his longsword. In a secret compartment in the bottom of the chest (Search DC 20) is a pouch holding 36 sp.\n\n\n Large Guest Room (EL 4)\nLike Snigrot, Derek is an aspiring assassin  but unlike the former, Derek is already an inspired killer. He is the only cult member who serves willingly, and is also the only one to have avoided Explictica’s charm. Until he is found out or becomes tired of Orlane, he will continue to serve his own interests, and to a lesser extent the cult’s, while still following orders. \nDerek Desleigh, male human Rog3/Ftr1: CR 4; SZ Medium; HD 3d6+6+1d10+2; hp 25; Init +7 (+3 Dex, +4 Imp Init); Spd 30 ft; AC 16 (+3 Dex, +3 leather); Atk +8 melee (1d6+2, 19-20/x2, mw shortsword), or +7 ranged (1d4+2, 10 ft, mw dagger); SA sneak attack +2d6; SQ evasion, uncanny dodge; AL CE; SV Fort +5, Ref +6, Will +2; Str 14, Dex 16, Con 14, Int 12, Wis 8, Chr 8.\nSkills: Appraise +4, Bluff +6, Climb +7, Disable Device +6, Escape Artist +6, Hide +10, Intimidate +4, Listen +4, Move Silently +10, Open Lock +8, Search +6, Spot +4, Use Rope +5.

The secret door can be found from this side with a Search check (DC 25), but cannot be opened from this side; one may try to smash or hack through it, of course [Hardness 5; hp 10; Break DC 25]. \n\t \n\nSmall Guest Room\nAs room 7, but with three beds. \n\n\n Crowded Guest Room\nTreat this room as common lodgings, but with four beds: the cost is a whopping 12 sp per bed per night, though (the fewer people per room, the happier the cult members are). The secret door is identical to those in 7 and 8.\n\n\nPosh Guest Room\nThis room is a step beyond good lodgings, meant for travelling nobility. The cost of 4 gp per night is justified. The secret door is identical to those in 7, 8, and 9.\n\n\nCult Members’ Room (EL 2)\nThese five are former brigands who have been captured and charmed into cult service. \nThugs, male human War1 (5): CR ½; SZ Medium; HD 1d8+1; hp 5; Init +0; Spd 30 ft; AC 14 (+3 studded leather, +1 shield); Atk +1 (1d3§, unarmed) or +2 melee (1d6, 19-20/x2, shortsword); SV Fort +2, Ref +0, Will +0; AL N; Str 11, Dex 10, Con 12, Int 10, Wis 10, Cha 10. \nSkills: Handle Animal +2, Listen +3, Search +1, Spot +3.

It has a +4 circumstance bonus to Hide, unless a PC specifically looks up.

They can use either Strength or Dexterity modifiers for Climb checks. \nNote: PCs should gain 1.3x experience for defeating this snake (advanced HD).\n\n\nSecret Treasure Room\n\n\nLarge Dirt Chamber (EL 2)\nAnother gift of the snake cult, this snake also has a +4 circumstance bonus to Hide among the rubble  but because it is even cooler here, it functions as if affected by a slow spell. \nMudviper (large viper): CR 2; SZ Large animal; HD 3d8; hp 19; Init +3; Spd 10 ft (usually 20 ft, climb 20 ft, swim 20 ft); AC 15 (-1 size, +3 Dex, +3 natural); Atk bite +4 melee (1d4 and poison); Face 5 ft x 5 ft (coiled); Reach 10 ft; SA poison; SQ scent; AL N; SV Fort +3, Ref +6, Will +2; Str 10, Dex 17, Con 11, Int 1, Wis 12, Chr 2. \nSkills: Balance +11, Climb +11, Hide +8, Listen +9, Spot +9.

Feats: Multiattack, Weapon Finesse (bite). \nSA – Paralysis (Su): Fort save (DC 14) or be paralyzed for 1d6+4 minutes. Elves are immune to ghoul paralysis.\nSA – Create spawn (Su): Humanoids killed and left undevoured by ghouls become ghouls under the command of their creator after 1d4 days. A protection from evil cast on the body during this period will prevent the spawn effect.  \nSQ – Undead: Immune to mind-influencing spells, poison, sleep, paralysis, stunning, disease, and any effect requiring a Fort save.  Not subject to critical hits, subdual damage, ability damage, energy drain, or death from massive damage.\n\n\nStatue of the Naga\nThe ivory statue is probably worth 5,000 gp  intact and to the right buyer. But it has a mass of about 800 lbs and its encumbrance is closer to 1,500 lbs. If broken up, its encumbrance can be reduced to its mass, but then it will be worth only about 1600 gp (2 gp per lb). \n\n\n\n\nInn of the Slumbering Serpent\nNot as fancy as the Golden Grain Inn, but this establishment has a more homey cheer.\n\nCommon Room\nBelba and Ollwen are well-known for their hospitality, their common sense, and their fine food and drink. Prices here are as those in the PHB (p.108), but the value one gets for one’s money is exceptional. The two are also widely respected for their tact and their ability to judge people fairly and accurately. \n\tIf any PC makes a Diplomacy check against Ollwin’s Will check then they have struck a friendship; or, heaven forbid, if a PC makes a Bluff check opposed to Ollwin’s Sense Motive check, they have fooled him into letting his guard down. In either case, he may then be moved to talk of the quiet respect he has for Ramne, and of his suspicion that there is far more to the old hermit than meets the eye. \nBelba Cralloon, female human Com2: CR ½; SZ Medium; HD 2d4; hp 4; Init +0; Spd 30 ft; AC 10; Atk non-combatant; SV Fort +0, Ref +0, Will +2; AL NG; Str 10, Dex 10, Con 11, Int 11, Wis 15, Cha 12. \nSkills: Knowledge (local) +2, Listen +2, Profession (innkeeper) +4, Profession (cook) +5, Sense Motive +5.

All within the temple are servants of the cult, and the two clerics are among the cult’s most adamant proponents. They both have lost access to any domains due to their fall from Merikka’s grace, but can access the standard cleric spells through the dark powers of the reptile cult. \n\tThe structure itself is made of huge granite blocks brought all the way from the Lortmil Mountains, and are several feet thick. The blocks were magically treated during construction, and are thus virtually impregnable [Hardness 12; hp 600*; Break DC 50; Climb DC 20]. The walls are 20 feet high, with strong, similarly enhanced wooden gates [Hardness 8; hp 300*; Break DC 40; Lift DC 35]. During the day, the gates are open; at night they are closed and will be opened only for cult members. \n\t* hit points per 10 ft x 10 ft section.\n\nCourtyard (EL 2)\nNote: I have made the wolves here into dogs, since it seemed odd that normal peasants, even charmed, would be able to handle the wolves. In 3E, dogs are about as tough as wolves were in 2nd ed. anyway. \nDuring the day, the gardener will be encountered (Com1; hp 3), but at night there are two large, vicious dogs that roam the area. The dogs will obey any one of the five servants, the gardener, and the clerics, but will attack anyone else. Two servants will be with the dogs at all times; any commotion will bring the other three servants within 1d3 minutes. \nLarge dogs (2): CR 1; SZ Medium animal; HD 2d8+4; hp 13; Init +2; Spd 40 ft; AC 16 (+2 Dex, +4 natural); Atk bite +4 melee (1d6+3); SQ low-light vision; AL N; SV Fort +5, Ref +5, Will +1; Str 15, Dex 15, Con 15, Int 2, Wis 12, Chr 6. \nSkills: Listen +5, Spot +5, Swim +5, Wilderness Lore +1 (+5 to track by scent). \nSQ – Scent (Ex): Detects opponents by scent within 30 feet — 60 feet if opponent is upwind, and 15 feet if downwind (double these ranges if odour is strong; triple if overpowering). \nServants, male or female human Com1: CR 1/3; SZ Medium; HD 1d4; hp 5; Init +0; Spd 30 ft; AC 12 (+2 leather); Atk +0 melee (1d6, x3, halfspear); SV Fort +0, Ref +0, Will +0; AL N; Str 11, Dex 10, Con 11, Int 10, Wis 10, Cha 10. \nSkills: Craft (any) +2, Handle Animal +2, Listen +2, Profession (any) +2, Spot +2, Use Rope +2. Feats: Skill Focus (Craft), Toughness. \n\n\nOutbuildings\nThese buildings house the five temple servants and the gardener, and include the dogs’ kennel as well. \n\n\nCentral Sanctuary\nThe characters will always be met here and informed that non-members (of the Church of Merikka, that is) are not allowed any further. There is a 30% chance that it will be Misha Devi (see room 9) who meets them; otherwise, it is one of the temple servants. \n\tThe jade statue of Merikka is worth about 5,000 gp, and weighs about 1,000 lbs. \n\n\nMeeting Room\n\n\nDining Hall\n\n\nKitchen\n\n\nb. – d.

If she is not here, the DM should determine where she can be found. If she has warning of the PCs, or if they have caused a commotion, she will try to find time to don her armour (and possibly her shield) before meeting them. \n\tThough she too has performed heinous deeds since she fell in with the cult, there may be hope for Misha if Explictica is killed and the evil charm broken. If Misha cannot be saved, there will be no cleric of Merikka left, for Abramo is now far beyond redemption. \n* To repeat, she and Abramo have lost access to any domains due to their fall from Merikka’s grace, but can access the standard cleric spells through the dark powers of the reptile cult.*\nMisha Devi, female human Clr3: CR 3; SZ Medium; HD 3d8; hp 15; Init +0; Spd 30 ft, 20 ft in armour; AC 10 (-1 Dex, +1 ring), or 16 in armour (+5 chainmail, +1 shield); Atk +4 melee (1d6+1, x2 crit, light mace); SA spells; SQ rebuke undead, spontaneous casting; AL N; SV Fort +3, Ref +0, Will +6; Str 12, Dex 9, Con 10, Int 12, Wis 16, Chr 15. \nSkills: Concentration +6, Craft (basketweaving) +2, Knowledge (local) +3, Knowledge (nature) +4, Knowledge (religion) +4, Listen +6, Profession (farmer) +4, Search +2, Spot +7.

The bottom trapdoor opens onto a ladder that allows access to area 19 in the temple’s secret cellar, while the top one opens into room 18, though means to reach it will have to be found. \n\n\nHall of Statues\nThe statues here are probably worth at least 5,000 gp each, but anyone removing one incurs Merikka’s curse: as a bestow curse  a Will save (DC 20) reduces the effect to that of a doom spell with a duration of three days. In either case, this is a 12th-level effect.\n\n\nGuardroom of the Undead (EL 3)\nSkeletons (8): CR 1/3; SZ Medium-size undead; HD 1d12; hp 6; Init +5; Spd 30 ft; AC 13 (+1 Dex, +2 natural); Atk: 2 claws +0 melee (1d4); SQ darkvision 60 ft, undead, immunities; AL N; SV Fort +0, Ref +1, Will +2; Str 10, Dex 12, Con –, Int , Wis 10, Chr 11. \nFeats: Improved Initiative. \nSQ – Undead: Immune to mind-influencing spells, poison, sleep, paralysis, stunning, disease, and any effect requiring a Fort save. Not subject to critical hits, subdual damage, ability damage, energy drain, or death from massive damage.\nSQ – Immunities (Ex): Skeletons have cold immunity and suffer half damage from piercing or slashing weapons. \n\n\nLibrary\n\n\nSmall Meeting Room\nThe secret door to 15 is difficult to find (Search DC 25), and cannot be opened from this direction in any case, though it may be smashed [Hardness 5; hp 15; Break DC 25]. \n\n\nTorture Chamber (EL 2)\nThe secret doors here are similar to the one in 13. Once the PCs move into this room, the goblins from 15 attack through the three secret doors, in groups of three. \nGoblins (9): CR 1/4; SZ Small humanoid (goblinoid); HD 1d8; hp 4; Init +1; Spd 30 ft; AC 15 (+1 size, +1 Dex, +3 studded leather); Atk +1 melee (1d6-1, 19-20/x2, shortsword), or +3 ranged (1d6, 60 ft, x3 crit, shortbow); SQ darkvision 60 ft; AL NE; SV Fort +2, Ref +1, Will +0; Str 8, Dex 13, Con 11, Int 10, Wis 11, Chr 8. \nSkills: Hide +6, Listen +3, Move Silently +4, Spot +3. Feats: Alertness.\n\n\nGoblins’ Quarters\nIf the goblins did not attack the PCs already for some reason, they wait here, hiding in the darkness, to ambush them. \n\n\nAntechamber (EL 7)\n* As a 7th-level cleric, Abramo is quite powerful: his (poor) selection of skills and spells and relatively low hit points should help to alleviate this somewhat, however. Still, DMs may want to alter his profile (perhaps make him a commoner 2 / cleric 5, or something), or else work in some other weakness(es) to balance the encounter. \nAbramo began his career as a lowly farmer, but, through his reverence for Merikka and her many blessings, he quickly came into the fold of her devout servants. Tragically, he was one of the first villagers to fall victim to the charm of Explictica Defilus the naga, however, and the resulting mental and emotional strain has proved too much for the poor man to endure. \n\tHe is now a pale shadow of his former dignified and gentle self, homicidal and sadistic, a deranged lunatic. He will not reason with the PCs, and, perhaps through some subconscious drive, seems to seek his own destruction  he is unlikely to surrender or retreat, no matter how terrible the odds or how injured he may be, unless he sees a threat to his beloved naga mistress that he may be able to prevent by escaping. \nAbramo, male human Clr7: CR 7; SZ Medium; HD 7d8+7; hp 35; Init +2; Spd 30 ft; AC 20 (+2 Dex, +6 chain shirt, +2 shield); Atk +7 melee (1d8+1, x2 crit, heavy mace); SA spells; SQ rebuke undead, spontaneous casting; AL CE; SV Fort +6, Ref +3, Will +8; Str 13, Dex 15, Con 12, Int 10, Wis 17, Chr 10. \nSkills: Concentration +7, Craft (stonemasonry) +1, Knowledge (local) +4, Knowledge (nature) +4, Knowledge (religion) +6, Listen +4, Profession (farmer) +6, Search +1, Spot +4. Feats: Combat Casting, Leadership, Silent Spell, Weapon Focus (heavy mace). \nCleric Spells (6/5/4/3/1) [DC 13 + spell level]: 0 – cure minor wounds, detect magic, detect poison, guidance, light, resistance; 1st – bane, cause fear, command, cure light wounds, detect good; 2nd – desecrate, silence, speak with animals, spiritual weapon (a glowing, floating serpent, which bites for standard spell damage); 3rd – animate dead, blindness, prayer; 4th  indiscernible lie (reverse of discern lie). \nPossessions: +2 chain shirt, unholy symbol, heavy mace.\n\n\nAbramo’s Chamber\nIf Abramo finds the need (but remember that he will not likely flee from battle), he can lock the door to this room: Hardness 5, hp 10, and Break DC 23.\n\tThe words on the desk-top have been etched in with a knife in the Common tongue. Upon closer examination, everything in the room has been damaged or tarnished in some way that makes it worthless. \n\tThe secret door to 18 can be found with a Search check (DC 16); the switch to open it can be found by making a similar check (DC 16) on the desk. Otherwise, the secret door has Hardness 5, hp 15, and Break DC 25.  \n\n\nSecret Altar Room\nCirilli Finla (hp 2; Wis 14, Chr 15), the teenage girl, will be as grateful and helpful as possible, but, due to her treatment at Abramo’s hands, will be highly averse to any kind of physical contact, flinching visibly and shying away from PCs who get too close. If Abramo lives, and particularly if he is helpless, she will attack him violently and mercilessly with whatever weapon she can find (a broken chunk of rock, anything).\n\tThe secret door behind the naga statue can be found with a Search check (DC 20); it leads down to room 9 on the temple’s ground floor, but there is no ladder down  fortunately, it opens directly above Misha’s bed, which allows a safe drop (unless she’s in it).\nTreasure: The jade statue, about two feet high, is worth 2,500 gp intact, but also weighs nearly 250 lbs (in encumbrance terms). The chests [Hardness 5; hp 15; Break DC 23] are unlocked, and one holds 12 gp, 14 sp, and 29 cp. \n\n\nHidden Hallway\n\n\nMaze (EL 3)\n* Since this ogre is described as small, I took off two points of Str and Con and one point of natural AC, and reduced his thrown rock range to 30 ft.\nThe spikes mounted in the maze walls make them easier to climb (DC 5), if anyone should want to, but also inflict damage on those who fall or are hurled against them. \n\tIn fact, this has become a favourite tactic of the ogre, who likes to Bull Rush opponents into the walls. His effective Strength bonus for Bull Rush checks is +8 (+4 Str, +4 size). If he is successful, his opponent takes 1d3 points of damage for each 5 feet travelled plus 4 points for the ogre’s Strength (i.e., if the ogre pushes a PC back 15 feet into a wall, she takes 3d3+4 points), and is also attacked by 1d4 spikes (+3 melee, 1d4 damage each). \nSmall ogre: CR 2; SZ Large giant; HD 4d8+4; hp 17; Init –1; Spd 30 ft.; AC 15 (-1 size, -1 Dex, +4 natural, +3 hide); Atk +7 melee (2d6+6, x2 crit, huge greatclub), +1 ranged (1d8+4, 30 ft, thrown rock); Reach 10 ft; SQ darkvision 60 ft; AL CE; SV Fort +6, Ref +0, Will +1; Str 19, Dex 8, Con 13, Int 6, Wis 10, Cha 7. \nSkills: Climb +4, Listen +2, Spot +2. Feats: Weapon Focus (greatclub).\n\n\nSecret Door\nThis secret door is made of stone (giving dwarves their racial bonus to find it), and can be found with a Search check (DC 20); once the door is found, its opening device can be found with a similar check (DC 10). The door otherwise has Hardness 8, hp 70, Break DC 30. \n\n\nTroglodyte Tunnels (EL 4)\nAnyone setting off the shrieker will attract the troglodytes, who will likely not be heard approaching due to the fungus’ great noise. \n\tAnyone moving through the mud-filled tunnels is reduced to half-speed, and suffers a –2 circumstance penalty to attack rolls and Listen checks, a –4 circumstance penalty to Balance, Jump, and Tumble checks, and a –8 circumstance penalty to Move Silently. \nShrieker: CR 1; SZ Medium-size plant; HD 2d8+2; hp 15; Init –5; Spd 0 ft.; AC 13 (+3 natural); Atk none; SA shriek; SQ plant; AL N; SV Fort +4, Ref , Will -4; Str , Dex , Con 13, Int 1, Wis 2, Cha 1. \nSA – Shriek (Ex): Movement or a light source within 10 feet of a shrieker causes it to emit a piercing sound that lasts for 1d3 rounds. This sound is liable to attract nearby monsters that are disposed to investigate it.\nSQ – Plant: Immune to mind-influencing effects, poison, sleep, paralysis, stunning, and polymorphing; not subject to critical hits.\nTroglodytes (4): CR 1; Medium-size humanoid (reptilian); HD 2d8+4; hp 13; Init -1; Spd 30 ft; AC 15 (-1 Dex, +6 natural); Atk +1 melee (1d6, x3 crit, handaxe) or 2 claws +1 melee (1d4), bite -1 melee (1d4); SA stench; SQ darkvision 90 ft; AL CE; SV Fort +5, Ref -1, Will +0; Str 10, Dex 9, Con 14, Int 8, Wis 10, Chr 10.  \nSkills: Hide +6*, Listen +3. Feats: Multiattack, Weapon Focus (handaxe).\nSA – Stench (Ex): When a trog is angry or frightened, it secretes an oily, musklike chemical that nearly every other form of animal life finds offensive. All creatures (except troglodytes) must succeed at a Fort save (DC 13) or be overcome with nausea: this lasts for 10 rounds and effectively deals 1d6 temporary Strength damage. \nSkills: A trog’s skin changes colours much like a chameleon, giving it a +4 racial bonus to Hide. *In rocky or subterranean settings, this bonus improves to +8. \nThe troglodytes’ treasure chest (or at least the spot where it’s buried) can be found with a successful Search check (DC 18). The key to the chest can be found similarly buried with a Search check (DC 25). \nTreasure: The chest [Hardness 5; hp 15; Break DC 23; Open Locks DC 25] contains 45 gp, 89 sp, 204 cp, and a silver brooch with an inset black opal (a brooch of shielding with 30 points of absorption remaining). \n\n\n\nCult Activity as Time Passes\nThis section needs little in the way of conversion, except that part dealing with resisting the naga’s charm. Those brought to her have to save against her charming gaze, and those who manage to do so can then attempt to pretend that they have been charmed if they wish. This requires both a second Will save (DC 17), to avoid giving one’s revulsion away, and a Bluff check, with a –4 circumstance penalty due to being wrapped in her coils, that successfully opposes Explictica’s Sense Motive check (her Sense Motive bonus is +3 for high Wis). \n\n\n\nThe Trail to the Reptile God[dess]’s Lair\n\nTracking\nAny creature or character with the scent ability or feat can track the troglodytes back to their marsh-lair automatically. Otherwise, the usual means of tracking apply: a character with the Track feat and Wilderness Lore [or a character with Search skill if the DC is 10 or lower], may follow the trail by making an appropriate skill check (base DC 5, but apply modifiers for visibility and terrain and for time having passed, PHB 86). \n\n\nCrossing the Plain\nNo encounters occur during the first day as the PCs cross toward the Dim Forest. Within one mile of the edge of the forest, roll for an encounter from the Dim Forest table twice per day (once during daylight hours, once at night): a ‘6’ on 1d6 indicates an encounter from that table.\n\n\nThrough the Dim Forest\nFor each day spent in the Dim Forest, roll 1d10, and an encounter occurs on a one (1); for each night spent therein, roll 1d10 twice  an encounter occurs on a 1. \n\tDim Forest Wandering Monster Table (d%)\n  Day\t   Night\tEncounter\n01-10\t   01-05\tBlack bear\n11-20\t   06-10\tDire badger*\n21-30\t      11\t\tGiant bombardier beetles (1d2)*\n    \t   12-25\tGoblins (1d6+4)*\n31-35\t   26-35\tMonstrous centipedes (Tiny) (2d4+6)\n36-45\t   36-40\tMonstrous spiders (Small) (1d4+2)*\n46-50\t   41-50\tOgre*\n   51\t   51-60\tSkeletons (2d4+3)*\n52-60\t   61-65\tTroglodytes (1d4+1)*\n61-75\t   66-70\tWild boar\n76-95\t   71-80\tWolves (1d4+3)\n96-00\t   81-00\tZombies (1d6+1)\n* This encounter will occur only once; if rolled a second time, reroll until a different encounter occurs.\n\n\nThe Muck of the Rushmoors\n\tAll movement within the moors is at half-speed, and PCs suffer a –2 circumstance penalty to Listen checks, a –4 circumstance penalty to Balance, Jump, and Tumble checks, and also a –8 circumstance penalty to Move Silently checks. \n\tFour rolls should be made for encounters during the day-long march across the fetid marsh: roll 1d8 for each check, and an encounter occurs on a one (1). \n\tRushmoors Wandering Monster Table (d%)\n  Day\t   Night\tEncounter\n01-10\t   01-10\tGiant leeches (1d4+1) (see Appendix 1)\n11-15\t   11-15\tGiant lizard \n16-25\t       \t\tGiant praying mantis*\n26-35\t      16\t\tGiant snapping turtle* (see Appendix 1)\n36-50\t   17-20\tShocker lizards (1d2)*\n   51\t   21-40\tSkeletons (2d4+3)\n52-60\t   41-45\tSnake, Large viper\n61-70\t   46-50\tSnake, Medium-size viper\n71-75\t   51-70\tStirges (1d4+3)*\n76-90\t   71-85\tTroglodytes (1d4+1)*\n91-00\t   86-00\tZombies (1d6+1)\n* This encounter will occur only once; if rolled a second time, reroll until a different encounter occurs.\n\n\n\nThe Dungeon of the Reptile God[dess]\n\nWandering Monsters  Level One (1 on 1d6: Roll every half hour)\nRoll 1d6. \n1. Dire rats (1d6+6): CR 1/3; SZ Small animal; HD 1d8+1; hp 5; Init +3; Spd 40 ft, climb 20 ft, swim 10 ft; AC 15 (+1 size, +3 Dex, +1 natural); Atk bite +2 melee (1d4); SA disease; SQ low-light vision, scent; AL N; SV Fort +3, Ref +5, Will +3; Str 10, Dex 17, Con 12, Int 1, Wis 12, Chr 4. \nSkills: Climb +11, Hide +11, Spot +6. Feats: Weapon Finesse (bite). \nSA – Disease (Ex): Those bitten must save (Fort DC 11), or contract disease with an incubation time of 1d3 days (1 Con/1 Dex and 1 Con). \nSQ – Scent (Ex): Senses creatures by smell within 30 feet (60 downwind, 15 upwind; double ranges if strong smell, triple if overpowering). Track by scent with Wisdom check (DC 10).\n2.

They get a +4 circumstance bonus to Hide and Move Silently checks. *In forested, overgrown, or swampy areas the Hide bonus improves to +8. \n3. Mudviper (large snake, viper): CR 2; SZ Large animal; HD 3d8; hp 19; Init +3; Spd 20 ft, climb 20 ft, swim 20 ft; AC 15 (-1 size, +3 Dex, +3 natural); Atk bite +4 melee (1d4 and poison); Face 5 ft x 5 ft (coiled); Reach 10 ft; SA poison; SQ scent; AL N; SV Fort +3, Ref +6, Will +2; Str 10, Dex 17, Con 11, Int 1, Wis 12, Chr 2. \nSkills: Balance +11, Climb +11, Hide +8, Listen +9, Spot +9. Feats: Weapon Finesse (bite).\nSA – Poison (Ex): Fort DC 11; 1d6 Con / 1d6 Con.\nSQ – Scent (Ex): Detects opponents by scent within 30 feet — 60 feet if opponent is upwind, and 15 feet if downwind (double these ranges if odour is strong; triple if overpowering). \nSkills: Snakes receive a +4 racial bonus to Hide, Listen, and Spot checks and a +8 racial bonus to Balance checks. They can use either Strength or Dexterity modifiers for Climb checks. \n4. Constrictor snake: CR 2; SZ Large animal; HD 6d8+12; hp 39; Init +3; Spd 20 ft, climb 20 ft, swim 20 ft; AC 15 (-1 size, +3 Dex, +3 natural); Atk bite +11 melee (1d6+6); Face 10 ft x 10 ft (coiled); Reach 10 ft; SA improved grab, constrict 1d6+9; SQ scent; AL N; SV Fort +7, Ref +8, Will +3; Str 23, Dex 17, Con 15, Int 1, Wis 12, Chr 2. \nSkills: Balance +11, Climb +17, Hide +7, Listen +9, Spot +9.\nSA – Improved grab (Ex): The snake must hit with its bite to use this ability; if it succeeds, it may constrict. \nSA – Constrict (Ex): This constrictor deals 1d6+9 points of damage per round with a successful grapple check against Large or smaller creatures.\nSQ – Scent (Ex): Detects opponents by scent within 30 feet — 60 feet if opponent is upwind, and 15 feet if downwind (double these ranges if odour is strong; triple if overpowering). \nSkills: Snakes receive a +4 racial bonus to Hide, Listen, and Spot checks and a +8 racial bonus to Balance checks.

Troglodytes (1d4+1): CR 1; Medium-size humanoid (reptilian); HD 2d8+4; hp 13; Init -1; Spd 30 ft; AC 15 (-1 Dex, +6 natural); Atk handaxe +1 (1d6) or 2 claws +1 melee (1d4), bite -1 melee (1d4); SA stench; SQ darkvision 90 ft; AL CE; SV Fort +5, Ref -1, Will +0; Str 10, Dex 9, Con 14, Int 8, Wis 10, Chr 10.  \nSkills: Hide +6*, Listen +3. Feats: Multiattack, Weapon Focus (handaxe).\nSA – Stench (Ex): When a trog is angry or frightened, it secretes an oily, musklike chemical that nearly every other form of animal life finds offensive. All creatures (except troglodytes) must succeed at a Fort save (DC 13) or be overcome with nausea: this lasts for 10 rounds and effectively deals 1d6 temporary Strength damage. \nSkills: A trog’s skin changes colours much like a chameleon, giving it a +4 racial bonus to Hide. *In rocky or subterranean settings, this bonus improves to +8. \n6. Dire weasel*: CR 2; SZ Medium animal; HD 3d8; hp 14; Init +4; Spd 40 ft; AC 16 (+4 Dex, +2 natural); Atk bite +6 melee (1d6+3); SA attach, blood drain; SQ low-light vision, scent; AL N; SV Fort +3, Ref +7, Will +4; Str 14, Dex 19, Con 10, Int 2, Wis 12, Chr 11. \nSkills: Hide +9, Move Silently +10, Spot +5. Feats: Weapon Finesse (bite). \nSA – Attach (Ex): A dire weasel that hits with its bite attack latches onto its opponent with its powerful jaws and begins to drain blood; an attached weasel loses its Dexterity bonus to AC (becoming AC 12). \nSA – Blood drain (Ex): A dire weasel drains blood for 2d4 points of temp Con damage each round that it is attached.\nSQ – Scent (Ex): Sense creatures by smell within 30 feet (60 downwind, 15 upwind; double ranges if strong smell, triple if overpowering). Track by successful Wisdom check (DC 10).\n* Note: The dire weasel encounter will occur only once; if the dire weasel is killed in a random encounter, it will not be encountered at area 18, its lair.\n\n\nKey to Dungeon Level One\n\nWooden Stairs\nDue to the slick mud on the stairs, any character coming down without taking precautions must make a Balance check (DC 12) or tumble downwards. Those who fall will knock any others in front down as well, unless those characters make new Balance checks (DC 15 + 1 per person falling into them). \n\tCharacters linked or secured by a rope or who move at quarter-speed or less do not have to roll a Balance check unless someone else stumbles into them. \n\n\nEntry Room\nSome light comes into this room from the stairway as well as from the torch-lit passage to the east. The four human guards here are accustomed to the low light and can see better than those who have just come in from the light (who are essentially blind for the first 1d3 minutes), though they still cannot see very well: the combat should be run in partial darkness. The PCs have one-quarter concealment from the guards, but the guards have three-quarters concealment from the PCs until their eyes adjust (see PHB 133). \n\tOf course, all of this is negated if the PCs have a light source. \nGuards (4): CR ½; SZ Medium; HD 1d8; hp 8; Init +0; Spd 30 ft; AC 13 (+2 leather, +1 small shield); Atk +2 melee (1d6, x3 crit, halfspear); AL N; SV Fort +2, Ref +0, Will +0; Str 11, Dex 10, Con 11, Int 10, Wis 10, Chr 10. \nSkills: Hide +1, Listen +1, Spot +1, Search +1. Feats: Toughness, Weapon Focus (spear).\nEach bears a key to open the door to room 8b. The passage leading south has torch brackets on the walls, but these currently have no torches in them. The passage to the west is dark. \n\n\nChamber of the Frogs\nThis door is swollen tightly shut with the dampness [Hardness 5; hp 15; Break DC 19]. Anyone breaking it down or smashing through it is certain to alert the killer frogs beyond, who will be hiding in the water waiting for the first PC to enter. \n\tMovement in this chamber is difficult and noisy: all non-aquatic creatures suffer a –4 to Move Silently checks. Further, due to the depth of mud and water, PCs will suffer further penalties, as follows: Large-sized or larger creatures suffer only a circumstance penalty of –2 to Balance checks; Medium-sized creatures (excluding dwarves) suffer a speed reduction of ½, a –2 circumstance penalty to attack rolls and Listen checks, and a –4 to all Balance, Jump, and Tumble checks; and Small-sized and smaller creatures (and also dwarves) move ¼ their usual speed, and suffer a –4 circumstance penalty to attack rolls and Listen checks, and a –8 circumstance penalty to Balance, Escape Artist, Hide, Jump, and Tumble checks.\nDire (killer) frogs (2): CR 1/3; SZ Small animal (aquatic); HD 1d8+4; hp 8; Init +1; Spd 15 ft., swim 20 ft; AC 13 (+1 size, +1 Dex, +1 natural); Atk bite +1 melee (1d4+1), claws –1 melee (1d3); SA jump; SQ low-light vision; AL N; SV Fort +6, Ref +3, Will +1; Str 13, Dex 12, Con 19, Int 2, Wis 13, Chr 6. \nSkills: Hide +9*, Jump +20, Listen +7, Move Silently +5, Spot +7. Feats: Multiattack. \nSA – Jump (Ex): Killer frogs can make spectacular leaping bites as part of an attack action (they can jump and then take full attacks, or move and then still jump and bite). If a killer frog attacks in the same round that it jumps, figure its bite as a charge attack. \nSkills: Frogs have a +15 racial bonus to Jump and are not limited to the usual maximum jumping distances by height. *Due to its coloration, a killer frog has a +4 racial bonus to Hide in weedy, marsh-like surroundings. This bonus improves to +12 when the frog is submerged in water. \nThe secret door (actually a plug of dirt that fills the 3-foot crawlspace) to the treasure room (4) can be noticed with a Search check (DC 18), and requires 2 minutes of work to remove. \n\n\nCult Treasure Chamber\nThe three chests on the platform are very sturdily brass-bound [Hardness 7; hp 25; Break DC 25; Open Locks DC 30], and they weigh 45 lbs each, not including their respective contents. \nTreasure: The first chest holds a jumbled mass of copperware  utensils, bowls, pots, cups, anything that might be of value  worth approximately 60 gp in total and weighing about 80 lbs. The second chest holds 450 sp and 7 silver holy symbols of Merikka (25 gp each). The third chest holds 1,207 cp and, scattered among them, 87 poor-quality ornamental stones (3d4 gp each) and 6 small semi-precious stones (2d4x5 gp each). \n\n\nCave-in\nAnyone moving through this mud-filled area is reduced to half-speed, and suffers a –2 circumstance penalty to attack rolls and Listen checks, a –4 circumstance penalty to Balance, Jump, and Tumble checks, and a –8 circumstance penalty to Move Silently. \n\n\nBurial Pool\nThis door to this chamber is swollen shut [Hardness 5; hp 15; Break DC 20].\n\n\nHome of the Green Slime\nAnyone moving through this slime and mud-filled area is reduced to half-speed, and suffers a –2 circumstance penalty to attack rolls and Listen checks, a –4 circumstance penalty to Balance, Jump, and Tumble checks, and a –8 circumstance penalty to Move Silently. \n\tThe green slime can normally be noticed with a Spot check (DC 20); anyone poking the slimy mud with a pole or spear will notice that the tool gets shorter (as the slime devours the end of it) in time to stop. Anyone walking into the slimy morass here will be attacked by the green slime. \nGreen Slime: CR 4; 1d6 points of temporary Con damage per round of contact; can be scraped off in first round, but must be frozen, burned, or cut away afterwards (doing damage to victim as well); 2d6 points of damage to wood or metal per round (ignores Hardness of metal); cold, heat, sunlight, or cure disease kills instantly. See DMG 117.\n\n\nHuman Cult Members’ Rooms\nThis section of hallway is lit by several torches that have had continual flame cast on them by Garath, the cleric. They are placed every 30 feet on wall-brackets (and thus providing ample shadow for those wishing to be furtive), from room 8a eastward and northward to 8e, and then from there southward and westward to the storage room (9). \n\tEach of the four cult members in 8a, 8c, and 8d bears a key to open the door to his or her own room. \nGuards (12): CR ½; SZ Medium; HD 1d8; hp 8; Init +0; Spd 30 ft; AC 13 (+2 leather, +1 small shield); Atk +2 melee (1d6, x3 crit, halfspear); AL N; SV Fort +2, Ref +0, Will +0; Str 11, Dex 10, Con 11, Int 10, Wis 10, Chr 10. \nSkills: Hide +1, Listen +1, Spot +1, Search +1. Feats: Toughness, Weapon Focus (spear).\n\n\nStorage Room\nThe door here is locked: Hardness 5; hp 15; Break DC 18; Open Locks DC 20. \n\n\nEmpty Pool\nPCs approaching this area from either direction should make a Listen check (DC 15 + 1 per 10 ft distance) to hear the sound of dripping water. \n\tAnyone in the mud-filled section of the hallway is reduced to half speed, and suffers a –2 circumstance penalty to attack rolls and Listen checks, a –4 circumstance penalty to Balance, Jump, and Tumble checks, and a –8 circumstance penalty to Move Silently. \n\n\nWine Storage\nThe door here is stoutly locked: Hardness 5; hp 15; Break DC 20; Open Locks DC 25. When the door is first tried, PCs may make a Spot check (DC 10) to notice some dirt fall from the ceiling. If the door is forced, the ceiling will collapse in a 10-foot radius; characters in the area when it collapses must make a Reflex save (DC 15). Those who succeed take 1d4 points of damage from falling dirt and timbers, but have leapt aside. Those who fail are buried under 1d4+3 feet of wet dirt and take 1d4+3 points of damage. Buried characters must make a Strength check (DC 15 + 1 per foot of dirt) or be trapped and helpless. \n\tHelpless characters must be rescued before they suffocate (see DMG 85). A free character may dig a comrade out at a rate of 2 feet per minute, without tools, or 5 feet per minute with shovels, plus one foot more or less by Strength modifier (eg., a 16 Str character digs 5 feet per minute unequipped, or 8 feet equipped; a 7 Str character digs 1 foot unequipped (the minimum) or 3 equipped). Up to four characters may work at digging out one 5 ft x 5 ft square. \n\n\nEmpty Rooms\nThis doors to these rooms are swollen shut [Hardness 5; hp 15; Break DC 20].\n\n\nEntry Hall\nThere are torch brackets mounted all around the room, and one is hung on each pillar as well (all are unlit). One hangs on either side of the passage on the north and south walls, and there is one in the middle of each of the east and west walls. \n\tAnyone in the mud-filled section of the chamber is reduced to half speed, and suffers a –2 circumstance penalty to attack rolls and Listen checks, a –4 circumstance penalty to Balance, Jump, and Tumble checks, and a –8 circumstance penalty to Move Silently. \n\n\nLieutenants’ Quarters (EL 5)\nWhen the party first comes to this room, unless they have given themselves away by being particularly noisy, for example, Blayze and Benn are lounging in 14a with drinks in hand. PCs who make a Listen check (DC 15) at the door will hear the sound of low conversation on the other side. However, the door is very stout, and is barred from the inside [Hardness 5; hp 15; Break DC 24]. \n\tIf the PCs try to break or hack the door down, there is a good chance that the occupants will have ample time to assume good defensive positions: Jarvis, the fighter, will be crouching behind an overturned table in the centre of the room, ready to hurl his spear at the first visible target (but note that he may have had to don his armour hastily; see PHB 105), and the two rogues will be flanking the door, ready to sneak attack the first ones to enter. Note that, with Combat Reflexes, the two should get attacks of opportunity against nearly anyone entering the room. Jarvis will not hesitate to meet any PC fighters in melee unless he or one of his companions have already been gravely wounded by magic or missile fire. \nJarvis Inigar, male human Ftr3: CR 3; SZ Medium; HD 3d10+9; hp 21; Init +2; Spd 30 ft, 20 ft in armour; AC 12 (+2 Dex), 15 with shield, 19 in armour; Atk +7 melee (1d8+3, 19-20/x2, longsword), or +5 ranged (1d6+3, 20 ft, halfspear); SV Fort +6, Ref +3, Will +1; AL NE; Str 17, Dex 14, Con 16, Int 10, Wis 11, Cha 8. \nSkills: Handle Animal +2, Jump +5(9), Listen +1, Ride +5, Search +1, Spot +1.

This door is locked [Hardness 5; hp 15; Break DC 22]. Hidden under the bed (Search DC 14) is a small locked chest [Hardness 5; hp 25; Break DC 25; Open Locks DC 25], which is trapped with a glyph of warding. \nGlyph of warding trap: CR 3; bestow curse; Will negates (DC 16); Search DC 28; Disable Device DC 28. Note: Anyone who opens the chest without saying aloud the name Explictica will be affected by a bestow curse spell (50% chance of losing all actions). \nTreasure: On the desk is a poorly crafted jade statue of Explictica (75 gp). In Garath’s chest are a masterwork light mace, his black and crimson clerical vestments, and a scroll with two cure light wounds spells on it. \n\n\nCrocodile Pool (EL 4) \nDue to the utter silence of the chamber and their own stillness, the crocodiles will be alerted by ripples if any creature larger than Tiny enters the water at a speed greater than 5 feet per round. And regardless, they get Listen checks at a +2 circumstance bonus to hear the PCs’ approach. Anyone in a boat is safe unless they enter the water, or perhaps drag a body part therein. Any creature in the water is almost sure to be attacked, however. \nCrocodiles (3): CR 2; SZ Medium-size animal (aquatic); HD 3d8+9; hp 22; Init +1; Spd 20 ft., swim 30 ft; AC 15 (+1 Dex, +4 natural); Atk bite +6 melee (1d8+6) or tail slap +6 melee (1d12+6); SA improved grab; SQ low-light vision; AL N; SV Fort +6, Ref +4, Will +2; Str 19, Dex 12, Con 17, Int 2, Wis 12, Chr 2. \nSkills: Hide +7*, Listen +5, Spot +5. \nSA – Improved grab (Ex): The crocodile must hit a Medium-size or smaller creature with its bite to use this ability; if it succeeds, it grabs on to its opponent and drags it into deep water, attempting to pin it to the bottom. The crocodile automatically deals bite damage each round it maintains the pin. \nSkills: A crocodile gains a +12 racial bonus to Hide when submerged. \n\n15a. Hidden Boat\n\n\nArched Chamber (EL 5)\nIf the PCs are wise and attentive, they will take great precaution before entering this area, given the warning of the door to the chamber (marked with an ‘X’ and barred from the outside). Otherwise, they may have a very hard time in this encounter. \n\tMovement in the mud-filled portion of this chamber is difficult and noisy due to the depth and viscosity of the mud: (i) Huge creatures suffer a –2 circumstance penalty to Listen checks and a speed reduction of ¼; (ii) Large creatures suffer a speed reduction of ½, a –3 circumstance penalty to attack rolls and Listen checks, and a –6 to all Balance, Jump, Move Silently, and Tumble checks; (iii) Medium-size creatures must make a Strength check (DC 15) or be rendered immobile and helpless; if the save succeeds, they are affected as if by a slow spell but, further, move only 1/8 their usual speed, suffer an additional –4 circumstance penalty to attack rolls and Listen checks, and suffer a –8 circumstance penalty to Balance, Escape Artist, Hide, Jump, Move Silently, and Tumble checks; and (iv) Small or smaller creatures are helpless without freedom of movement or similar effects. \n\tMeanwhile, the harpy from area 17 will swoop to the attack.\nHarpy: CR 4; SZ Medium monstrous humanoid; HD 7d8; hp 22; Init +2; Spd 20 ft, fly 80 ft (average); AC 13 (+2 Dex, +1 natural); Atk +7/+2 melee (1d4, 19-20/x2, dagger) and 2 claws +2 melee (1d3); SA captivating song; SQ darkvision 60 ft; AL CE; SV Fort +2, Ref +7, Will +5; Str 10, Dex 15, Con 10, Int 7, Wis 10, Chr 15. \nSkills: Bluff +8, Listen +7, Perform (buffoonery, chant, epic, limericks, melody, ode, story-telling) +9, Spot +6. Feats: Dodge, Fly-By Attack. \nSA – Captivating song (Sp) [sonic, mind-affecting charm]: All within a 300-foot radius must make a Will save (DC 15) or be drawn directly to the harpy, taking no action except to defend (no other movement or attack actions). An affected victim within 5 feet of the harpy takes no actions and can offer no resistance to its attacks. This effect continues as long as the harpy sings. A creature who saves cannot be affected by that harpy’s song for one day. A bard’s countersong ability allows the captivated creature a new Will save.\n\n\nDen of the Harpy\nA PC could climb the walls over or around the mud-pit (Climb DC 20), but is at risk of being attacked while doing so if the harpy is still at large. See PHB 64-5, Climb, for details on speeds of climbing and rules for being attacked while doing so. \n\tThe timber(s) from room 9 might also be used to cross the mud safely, though each weighs about 200 lbs, as is, and would require some tight maneuvering to bring down the hall. Crossing on these timbers would require a Balance check (DC 15), as the timbers are 9 in. wide, but have angled, i.e., slightly rounded, surfaces. Further, there is a chance that the character may be attacked while crossing, as above. See PHB 63-4, Balance, for details on speeds while crossing and rules for being attacked while doing so. \nTreasure: The harpy has collected a number of pretty baubles from previous victims, and these are draped decoratively (in plain view) about her nest: a small red garnet medallion (looks at first glance or to the untrained like a ruby) on a light gold chain (500 gp); a fine gold chain with a carnelian pendant (130 gp); a gold chain cloak-clasp with an ivory cameo (105 gp); a delicate silver necklace with numerous tiny inset amber stones (several stones are missing  100 gp); a finely crafted gold necklace (90 gp) and matching bracelet (55 gp); a thick gold chain (85 gp); a silver chain with an onyx clasp (70 gp); a necklace of adaptation (looks like a plain gold chain worth 50 gp); a thick silver-plate bracelet with lapis lazuli designs (40 gp); and a heavy but intricate copper-mesh chain with a decorative clasp (20 gp).\n\n\nLair of the Giant Weasel\n* Note: There is only one dire weasel that lairs in the dungeon; if the dire weasel was killed in a random encounter, it will not be encountered here. (Though if it was wounded and escaped previously, it may have come here to nurse its wounds.)\n\tAny creature in a mud-filled area, including the dire weasel, is reduced to half speed and suffers a –2 circumstance penalty to attack rolls and Listen checks, a –4 circumstance penalty to Balance, Jump, and Tumble checks, and a –8 circumstance penalty to Move Silently. \nDire weasel: CR 2; SZ Medium animal; HD 3d8; hp 14; Init +4; Spd 40 ft; AC 16 (+4 Dex, +2 natural); Atk bite +6 melee (1d6+3); SA attach, blood drain; SQ low-light vision, scent; AL N; SV Fort +3, Ref +7, Will +4; Str 14, Dex 19, Con 10, Int 2, Wis 12, Chr 11. \nSkills: Hide +9, Move Silently +10, Spot +5. Feats: Weapon Finesse (bite). \nSA – Attach (Ex): A dire weasel that hits with its bite attack latches onto its opponent with its powerful jaws and begins to drain blood; an attached weasel loses its Dexterity bonus to AC (becoming AC 12). \nSA – Blood drain (Ex): A dire weasel drains blood for 2d4 points of temp Con damage each round that it is attached.\nSQ – Scent (Ex): Sense creatures by smell within 30 feet (60 downwind, 15 upwind; double ranges if strong smell, triple if overpowering). Track by successful Wisdom check (DC 10).\n\tBuried in the mud of the weasel’s chamber are the variously aged remains of several unfortunate cult members, along with moldering equipment, as well as of numerous dire rats and other creatures. A Search check (DC 16) will uncover a torn and stained pouch holding 2 gp, 13 sp, and 11 cp  a subsequent and more thorough Search (DC 20) of the mud in the pouch’s vicinity will uncover another 1d10 gp, 4d10 sp, and 5d10 cp. \n\n\nCorridor\n\tAny creature in a mud-filled area is reduced to half speed and suffers a –2 circumstance penalty to attack rolls and Listen checks, a –4 circumstance penalty to Balance, Jump, and Tumble checks, and a –8 circumstance penalty to Move Silently. \n\n\nTroglodyte Guardroom (EL 4)\nThe door to 20a is barred from the inside: Hardness 5; hp 15; Break DC 24. There are six troglodyte guards here in all; unless an alarm has been raised or the PCs have been making a great deal of noise, two trogs are currently in each of 20a, 20b, and 20c. Be sure to roll Listen checks for those in 20b and 20c, at appropriate penalties for closed doors and distance, if the PCs manage to break into the first room. If they need to, all of the trogs can retreat from 20a into 20b and bar the second door there, as well. \nTroglodytes (6): CR 1; Medium-size humanoid (reptilian); HD 2d8+4; hp 13; Init -1; Spd 30 ft; AC 15 (-1 Dex, +6 natural); Atk +1 melee (1d6, x3 crit, handaxe) or 2 claws +1 melee (1d4), bite -1 melee (1d4); SA stench; SQ darkvision 90 ft; AL CE; SV Fort +5, Ref -1, Will +0; Str 10, Dex 9, Con 14, Int 8, Wis 10, Chr 10.  \nSkills: Hide +6*, Listen +3. Feats: Multiattack, Weapon Focus (handaxe).\nSA – Stench (Ex): When a trog is angry or frightened, it secretes an oily, musklike chemical that nearly every other form of animal life finds offensive. All creatures (except troglodytes) must succeed at a Fort save (DC 13) or be overcome with nausea: this lasts for 10 rounds and effectively deals 1d6 temporary Strength damage. \nSkills: A trog’s skin changes colours much like a chameleon, giving it a +4 racial bonus to Hide. *In rocky or subterranean settings, this bonus improves to +8. \nPossessions: stone handaxe, belt pouch, 2d4 gp, 2d6 sp, 2d8 cp.\n\n\n\nDungeon Level Two\n\nWandering Monsters  Level Two (1 on 1d6: Roll every half hour)\nRoll 1d6. \n1.

Elves are immune to ghoul paralysis.\nSA – Create spawn (Su): Humanoids killed and left undevoured by ghouls become ghouls under the command of their creator after 1d4 days. A protection from evil cast on the body during this period will prevent the spawn effect.  \nSQ – Undead: Immune to mind-influencing spells, poison, sleep, paralysis, stunning, disease, and any effect requiring a Fortitude save. Not subject to critical hits, subdual damage, ability damage, energy drain, or death from massive damage.\n6.

Track by successful Wisdom check (max DC 10).\n\n\n\nKey to Dungeon Level Two\n\nMud Cavern\n\tAny creature in a mud-filled area is reduced to half speed and suffers a –2 circumstance penalty to attack rolls and Listen checks, a –4 circumstance penalty to Balance, Jump, and Tumble checks, and a –8 circumstance penalty to Move Silently. \n\tCharacters crossing on the stepping stones must make Balance checks (DC 10) to do so; given the luxury of time (i.e., ‘taking 10’), an average person can cross at half speed without slipping or falling. However, if one tries to cross more quickly, or is attacked while crossing, more checks will be necessary and there is a chance that he or she will fall into the mud. \n\n\nSpider’s Lair\nBe sure to roll Spot checks for both the spider and the PCs, who will suffer a –4 circumstance penalty to see the spider unless they specifically look upwards when they enter.\nMonstrous (hunting) spider, Medium-size: CR 1; SZ Medium-size vermin; HD 2d8+2; hp 11; Init +3; Spd 40 ft, climb 20 ft; AC 14 (+3 Dex, +1 natural); Atk bite +4 melee (1d6 and poison); SA poison; SQ blindsight 30 ft, vermin; AL N; SV Fort +4, Ref +3, Will +0; Str 11, Dex 17, Con 12, Int , Wis 10, Chr 2. \nSkills: Climb +10, Hide +14, Jump +6, Spot +11.

The boat will hold the equivalent of two Medium-size creatures, and a maximum weight of 500 lbs. The two chests are identical to those in the first treasure room (4) [Hardness 7; hp 25; Break DC 25; Open Locks DC 30]. However, one of them is trapped with a poisoned needle.\nPoison needle trap: CR 2; +8 melee (1, and poison  Fort DC 11, initial 1d4 Con / secondary 1d6 Con; Search DC 22; Disable Device DC 20. \nTreasure: The trapped chest holds 77 gp and 1,000 sp, a jewelled silver decanter (250 gp), and a masterwork Medium-sized breastplate with the heraldic symbol of burnished gold dragon, rampant, worked into it (500 gp). The second chest holds 600 sp, a pearl bracelet (1,000 gp), and 17 valuable stones (5d4 gp each). \n\n\nChamber of the Dead\nThe south door to this chamber is locked and, further, swollen shut with moisture [Hardness 5; hp 15; Break DC 25]. The door to the north is also locked [Hardness 5; hp 15; Break DC 23; Open Locks DC 20]. When the PCs enter, be sure to roll a Hide check for the coffer corpse (see Appendix 1) with bonuses for concealment (behind the pillar) and darkness, and to roll Spot checks for the PCs with modifiers for distance. \nCoffer corpse: CR 1; SZ Medium-size undead; HD 2d12; hp 16; Init +1; Spd 30 ft; AC 12 (+1 Dex, +1 natural); Atk bash +2 melee (1d6+1); SA improved grab, frightful presence; SQ darkvision 60 ft, undead, +4 turn resistance, damage reduction 10/+1; AL CE; SV Fort +0, Ref +0, Will +2; Str 13, Dex 10, Con , Int 6, Wis 10, Chr 12. \nSkills: Bluff +12, Hide +5, Listen +2, Move Silently +5, Spot +2. Feats: Toughness. \nSA – Improved grab (Ex): If a coffer corpse hits with its bash attack, it deals normal damage and latches onto its opponent as a free action, without provoking an attack of opportunity. Each subsequent round, it does normal bash damage and it is not itself considered grappled while it holds an opponent. \nSA – Frightful presence (Ex): Once its opponents have inflicted 15 or more points of damage on a coffer corpse with non-magical weapons, whether or not any of this damage has actually penetrated the creature’s damage resistance, it falls to the ground, feigning lifelessness. Then, in the next round, it stands up again as a move-equivalent action. By doing so, it evokes its frightful presence. All opponents within 30 feet who witness this unsettling resurrection must make a Will save (DC 12) or be frightened for 2d4 rounds. A creature who succeeds at this Will save is immune to the frightful presence of that particular coffer corpse for one day. \nSQ – Undead: Immune to mind-influencing spells, poison, sleep, paralysis, stunning, disease, and any effect requiring a Fortitude save. Not subject to critical hits, subdual damage, ability damage, energy drain, or death from massive damage.\n\n\nCells of the Doomed\nThis prison chamber is a good opportunity for DMs to put NPCs who might help the party, or even new PCs (if someone has a character who has died during this adventure).\n\n\nZombie Factory\n\n\nAltar of Evil (EL 6)\nI have altered the descriptive boxed text for this room just slightly, as the original wording draws attention too obviously to the fact that Garath’s assistant is not human. \n* Note that this is an extremely challenging encounter for 2nd-level characters  DMs may wish to substitute a zombie or ghoul in place of the wight, which is probably challenge enough in itself. \nThis is a long room with walls covered by wooden planks. At the far end is a raised wooden dais with an altar supporting a statue of the reptile god  a snake with a human head. Next to the altar is a man in heavy clerical robes, who seems to be expecting you.

Any PC in this mud-filled area is reduced to half speed and suffers a –2 circumstance penalty to attack rolls and Listen checks, a –4 circumstance penalty to Balance, Jump, and Tumble checks, and a –8 circumstance penalty to Move Silently. \n\tOnce the centipedes are defeated, a character who makes a Listen check (DC 20) will hear the faint sounds of trickling water and creaking (coming from the Pumproom, 29). \nMonstrous centipedes, Small (9): CR ¼; SZ Small vermin; HD ½d8; hp 2; Init +2; Spd 30 ft; AC 14 (+1 size, +2 Dex, +1 natural); Atk bite +3 melee (1d4-3 and poison); SA poison; SQ vermin; AL N; SV Fort +2, Ref +2, Will +0; Str 5, Dex 15, Con 10, Int –, Wis 10, Cha 2. \nSkills: Climb +5, Hide +13, Spot +7.

Not subject to critical hits, subdual damage, ability damage, energy drain, or death from massive damage. \n\n\nMud Trap (EL 5)\nThe chest is identical to those in the first two treasure rooms (4 and 23) [Hardness 7; hp 25; Break DC 25; Open Locks DC 30]. However, this chest is trapped: anyone who opens it, either by force or by picking the lock, will cause the ceiling to collapse in a 10-foot radius. \n* Note that this trap can be detected by any character with a successful Search or Knowledge (engineering) check. \nCollapsing ceiling trap: CR 5; +10 melee (1d6+2 and entrapment); Search or Knowledge (engineering) DC 20; Disable Device DC 30. Note: All characters who take damage from the cave-in must make a Reflex save (DC 14) or be entrapped. An entrapped character is pinned under a pile of mud and possibly a beam, and will begin to suffocate (see DMG 88). The pinned character may make one attempt to escape on his or her own, with either a successful Escape Artist check (DC 18) or Strength check (DC 20). Note that in this case an Escape Artist check requires a full minute. Another character may assist an entrapped comrade by making a Strength check (DC 15), which may be attempted each round until successful  but a successful check has a 50% chance of triggering another collapse, affecting all currently in the room. \n\n\nEmpty Cave\nThose in the hallway looking towards 33 will notice a terrible stench (they may recognize it as that of troglodytes if they ask and are familiar with that smell).\n\n\nEmpty Cave\nCharacters who make a Listen check (DC 24) will hear the faint sounds of trickling water and creaking (coming from the Pumproom, 29). Further, those in the hallway looking towards 33 will notice a terrible stench (they will recognize it as that of troglodytes if they ask). \n\n\nTroglodyte Lair (EL 4)\n* To balance the difficulty of this encounter, I have made only the two sentries adults, while the other five are immature (but still combatant) troglodytes. This is justified, I think, since in the original module the five extras were described as female and, therefore, weaker  I am simply assuming that male and female trogs are equally powerful, and that these five are weaker because they are young (this incidentally rectifies the (eco)logical problem of there being a room full of trog eggs next door (34), but no young about).\nAnyone in the muddy area approaching this chamber is reduced to half speed and suffers a –2 circumstance penalty to attack rolls and Listen checks, a –4 circumstance penalty to Balance, Jump, and Tumble checks, and a –8 circumstance penalty to Move Silently. \n\tAt each position marked ‘T’ on the map hides a sentry with a spear; the other five occupants are either playing about in 34, or, if they hear intruders, hiding quietly in this great chamber. The young are quite fearless, and will happily attack intruders (though they know to avoid the mudviper if it is released). None of these trogs will retreat, as they are guarding the hatchery. \nTroglodyte adults (2): CR 1; Medium-size humanoid (reptilian); HD 2d8+4; hp 13; Init -1; Spd 30 ft; AC 15 (-1 Dex, +6 natural); Atk +1 melee (1d8, x3 crit, shortspear) or 2 claws +1 melee (1d4), bite -1 melee (1d4); SA stench; SQ darkvision 90 ft; AL CE; SV Fort +5, Ref -1, Will +0; Str 10, Dex 9, Con 14, Int 8, Wis 10, Chr 10.  \nSkills: Hide +6*, Listen +3. Feats: Multiattack, Weapon Focus (shortspear).\nSA – Stench (Ex): When a trog is angry or frightened, it secretes an oily, musklike chemical that nearly every other form of animal life finds offensive. All creatures (except troglodytes) must succeed at a Fort save (DC 13) or be overcome with nausea: this lasts for 10 rounds and effectively deals 1d6 temporary Strength damage. \nSkills: A trog’s skin changes colours much like a chameleon, giving it a +4 racial bonus to Hide. *In rocky or subterranean settings, this bonus improves to +8. \nPossessions: shortspear, belt pouch, 2d4 gp, 2d6 sp, 2d8 cp.\nTroglodyte young (5): CR ½; Small humanoid (reptilian); HD 1d8+2; hp 6; Init +0; Spd 30 ft; AC 15 (+1 size, +4 natural); Atk 2 claws -1 melee (1d2-1), bite -3 melee (1d3-1); SA stench; SQ darkvision 90 ft; AL CE; SV Fort +4, Ref +0, Will +0; Str 8, Dex 11, Con 14, Int 6, Wis 10, Chr 10.  \nSkills: Hide +10*, Listen +3. Feats: Multiattack.\nSA – Stench (Ex): These young trogs’ stech is not as powerful as the adults’. All creatures (except troglodytes) must succeed at a Fort save (DC 12) or be overcome with nausea: this lasts for only 5 rounds and effectively deals 1d4 temporary Strength damage. \nSkills: A trog’s skin changes colours much like a chameleon, giving it a +4 racial bonus to Hide. *In rocky or subterranean settings, this bonus improves to +8. \nIf they have the opportunity, the two adult trogs will hurl a large, frail wicker cage holding a mudviper in the PCs’ direction (as the snake is Large, it will require both of them to throw it in this way). The trogs must roll to hit AC 10 with the cage; if they succeed, the cage has broken open on the floor somewhere within 10 feet of a PC (and thus within striking distance, given the snake’s reach).\nMudviper (Large snake, viper): CR 2; SZ Large animal; HD 3d8; hp 19; Init +3; Spd 20 ft, climb 20 ft, swim 20 ft; AC 15 (-1 size, +3 Dex, +3 natural); Atk bite +4 melee (1d4 and poison); Face 5 ft x 5 ft (coiled); Reach 10 ft; SA poison; SQ scent; AL N; SV Fort +3, Ref +6, Will +2; Str 10, Dex 17, Con 11, Int 1, Wis 12, Chr 2. \nSkills: Balance +11, Climb +11, Hide +8, Listen +9, Spot +9.

They can use either Strength or Dexterity modifiers for Climb checks. \nTreasure: Buried in the dirt in the NW corner of the chamber (Search DC 20) are a few leather sacks containing the troglodytes’ treasure: a silver figurine of a mounted human warrior, obviously not crafted by trogs (250 gp); 7 gold trade bars (40 gp each); 490 sp; two black pearls (350 gp and 200 gp, respectively); and two uncut bits of amber (110 gp and 80 gp). \n\n\nTroglodyte Hatchery\nThough there are over a hundred trog eggs here, but usually less than one-tenth of them will survive to adulthood. \n\n\nMudviper Hatchery (EL ?)\nThere are several thousand tiny mudvipers here, all kept in the room by a small wicker wall built across the entrance-way. Entering this room is quite foolish, as their venom is potentially every bit as deadly as that of full grown snakes. \nMudviper young (Tiny snake, viper): CR 1/3; SZ Tiny animal; HD ¼d8; hp 1; Init +3; Spd 15 ft, climb 15 ft, swim 15 ft; AC 17 (+2 size, +3 Dex, +2 natural); Atk bite +5 melee (poison); Face 2½ ft x 2½ ft (coiled); Reach 0 ft; SA poison; SQ scent; AL N; SV Fort +2, Ref +5, Will +1; Str 6, Dex 17, Con 11, Int 1, Wis 12, Chr 2. \nSkills: Balance +11, Climb +12, Hide +18, Listen +8, Spot +8.

They can use either Strength or Dexterity modifiers for Climb checks. \n\n\nBonesnapper’s Lair\nThe bonesnapper (see Appendix 1) cannot attack opponents who remain within 5 feet of the south wall of the passageway here, as its chain holds it 10 feet from the wall. However, note that passing by the creature without it bellowing (and thus warning Explictica) is difficult, given its darkvision and scent abilities. \nBonesnapper: CR 2; SZ Medium-size beast; HD 4d10+12; hp 32; Init +2; Spd 30 ft.; AC 16 (+2 Dex, +4 natural); Atk bite +5 melee (1d8+4), tail rake +0 melee (1d4+1); SA improved grab; SQ darkvision 60 ft, low-light vision, scent; AL N; SV Fort +7, Ref +6, Will +2; Str 15, Dex 14, Con 17, Int 2, Wis 12, Chr 7. \nSkills: Hide +7*, Listen +7, Spot +7.\nSA – Improved grab (Ex): If a bonesnapper hits with its bite attack, it deals normal damage and latches onto its opponent as a free action, without provoking an attack of opportunity. Each subsequent round, it does normal bite damage and it is not itself considered grappled while it holds an opponent. \nSQ – Scent (Ex): Detects opponents by scent within 30 feet — 60 feet if opponent is upwind, and 15 feet if downwind (double these ranges if odour is strong; triple if overpowering). \nSkills: *Due to its coloration, a bonesnapper has a +4 racial bonus to Hide in natural surroundings or underground. \n\n\nThrone Room of Explictica Defilus\n* A spirit naga is a very powerful opponent (at least in terms of a 2nd-level party), and DMs may wish to find some way to offset some of Explictica’s other strengths (her poison, for example) in order to give the PCs a fighting chance; note firstly that she has considerably more hit points in this version. Note also that in 1st edition, a naga did 1d3 points of damage, plus poison, while Explictica now does 2d6+6 points of damage with a bite  a substantial increase. The module suggests that Ramne might blind her using a light spell to prevent her charming gaze attack, but this is no longer an option, so I gave him blindness instead. Another possibility might be to have the PCs find neutralize poison scroll(s) or potion(s) somewhere during the adventure, for example. Finally, be sure to have Ramne use dispel magic and lightning bolt, as well as his minor globe of invulnerability, if needed. His rod of wonder can be used as a last resort. \nExplictica Defilus, spirit naga: CR 9; SZ Large aberration; HD 9d8+36; hp 76; Init +1; Spd 40 ft.; AC 16 (-1 size, +1 Dex, +6 natural); Atk bite +9 melee (2d6+6 and poison); Face 5 ft x 5 ft (coiled); Reach 10 ft; SA poison, charming gaze, spells; SQ darkvision 60 ft; AL CE; SV Fort +7, Ref +6, Will +9; Str 18, Dex 13, Con 18, Int 12, Wis 17, Chr 17. \nSkills: Concentration +13, Knowledge (arcana) +10, Listen +15, Spot +15.

A bonesnapper is typically 5 feet tall, with a tail nearly 8 feet in length. It is a grey-green colour, mottled with dark grey spots and patches. Its eyes are quite small and scarlet coloured, and its teeth are prominent and yellowish-white. \nCombat\nBonesnappers generally lie in hiding along frequented trails, waiting for prey to come to them. Due to its aggressive nature, a bonesnapper always fights to the death. It attacks with its vicious, crushing bite, and by lashing with its serrated tail, which is long enough to attack opponents in any direction. \n\tImproved grab (Ex): If a bonesnapper hits with its bite attack, it deals normal damage and latches onto its opponent as a free action, without provoking an attack of opportunity. Each subsequent round, it does normal bite damage and it is not itself considered grappled while it holds an opponent. \n\tSkills: *Due to its coloration, a bonesnapper has a +4 racial bonus to Hide in natural surroundings or underground. \n\n\ncoffer corpse (Fiend Folio)\nMedium-size Undead\nHit Dice: 2d12 (16 hp)\nInitiative: +1 (Dex)\nSpeed: 30 ft.\nAC: 12 (+1 Dex, +1 natural)\nAttacks: Bash +2 melee; light mace +2 melee\nDamage: Bash 1d6+1; light mace 1d6+1\nFace/Reach: 5 ft by 5 ft. / 5 ft.\nSpecial Attacks: Improved grab, frightful presence\nSpecial Qualities: Undead, +4 turn resistance, damage reduction 10/+1\nSaves: Fort +0, Ref +0, Will +2\nAbilities: Str 13, Dex 10, Con , Int 6, Wis 10, Chr 12\nSkills: Hide +5, Listen +2, Move Silently +5, Spot +2 \nFeats: Toughness\nClimate/Terrain: Any land and underground\nOrganization: Solitary\nCR: 1\nTreasure: None\nAlignment: Always chaotic evil\nAdvancement: 3-6 HD (Medium-size)\nThese foul creatures are sometimes found in stranded funeral barges as well as crypts and dungeons. A coffer corpse is virtually indistinguishable from a zombie. \nCombat\nA coffer corpse is occasionally found with a weapon, but otherwise it attacks with its bare hands, latching onto opponents and clawing or strangling with its unnatural strength. Most notably, a coffer corpse will use a frightening tactic that involves fooling opponents into thinking that their normal weapons have in fact destroyed it, and then rising again to terrifying effect. \n\tImproved grab (Ex): If a coffer corpse hits with its bash attack, it deals normal damage and latches onto its opponent as a free action, without provoking an attack of opportunity. Each subsequent round, it does normal bash damage and it is not itself considered grappled while it holds an opponent. \n\tFrightful presence (Ex): Once its opponents have inflicted 15 or more points of damage on a coffer corpse, whether or not any of this damage has actually penetrated the creature’s damage resistance, it falls to the ground, feigning lifelessness. Then, in the next round, it stands up again as a move-equivalent action, and by doing so evokes its frightful presence. All opponents within 30 feet who witness this unsettling resurrection must make a Will save (DC 12) or be frightened for 2d4 rounds. A creature who succeeds at this Will save is immune to the frightful presence of that particular coffer corpse for one day. \n\n\nfrog, dire (killer frog) (Monster Manual)\nSmall Animal (aquatic)\nHit Dice: 1d8+4 (8 hp)\nInitiative: +1 (Dex)\nSpeed: 15 ft., swim 20 ft\nAC: 13 (+1 size, +1 Dex, +1 natural)\nAttacks: Bite +1 melee; claws –1 melee\nDamage: Bite 1d4+1; claws 1d3\nFace/Reach: 5 ft by 5 ft. / 5 ft.\nSpecial Attacks: Jump\nSaves: Fort +6, Ref +3, Will +1\nAbilities: Str 13, Dex 12, Con 19, Int 2, Wis 13, Chr 6\nSkills: Hide +9*, Jump +20, Listen +7, Move Silently +5, Spot +7\nFeats: Multiattack\nClimate/Terrain: Temperate and warm swamp or aquatic\nOrganization: Solitary, clutch (2-5), or swarm (7-18)\nCR: 1/3\nTreasure: None\nAlignment: Always neutral \nAdvancement: 2-4 HD (Small); 5-6 HD (Medium-size)\nThese extremely aggressive aquatic predators are typically 2-3 feet long. They lie mostly submerged in rivers or marshes, with only their eyes showing, waiting for prey to come within reach of their leaping attacks. \nCombat\nJump (Ex): Killer frogs can make spectacular leaping bites as part of an attack action (they can jump and then take full attacks, or move and then still jump and bite). If a killer frog attacks in the same round that it jumps, figure its bite as a charge attack. \nSkills: Frogs have a +15 racial bonus to Jump and are not limited to the usual maximum jumping distances by height. *Due to its coloration, a killer frog has a +4 racial bonus to Hide in weedy, marsh-like surroundings. This bonus improves to +12 when the frog is submerged in water. \n\n\nleech, giant (Monster Manual)\nSmall Vermin\nHit Dice: 1d8+1 (5 hp)\nInitiative: +1 (Dex)\nSpeed: 5 ft, swim 10 ft.\nAC: 11 (+1 Dex)\nAttacks: Touch +1 melee\nDamage: Touch 1d6-3\nFace/Reach: 5 ft by 5 ft. / 5 ft.\nSpecial Attacks: Attach, anesthetizing mucus, blood drain, disease\nSpecial Qualities: Tremorsense, salt vulnerability\nSaves: Fort +3, Ref +1, Will +0\nAbilities: Str 4, Dex 13, Con 12, Int , Wis 10, Chr 2\nSkills: Hide +13 \nFeats: Weapon Finesse (bite)\nClimate/Terrain: Temperate and warm aquatic\nOrganization: Cluster (2-5) or swarm (4-16)\nCR: ½\nTreasure: None\nAlignment: Always neutral\nAdvancement: 2-4 HD (Small); 5-6 HD (Medium-size)\nGiant leeches are horrid, slug-like creatures that dwell in wet, slimy areas and suck the blood of warm-blooded creatures. They typically range from 2 to 3 feet long, though some can grow as large as 5 feet, and their skin is a mottled brown and tan with an occasional shade of grey.\nCombat\nLeeches wait in the mud and slime for prey to pass by. Generally, there will be some larger leeches (of greater HD) in any given group.\n\tAttach (Ex): If a leech hits an opponent with its touch attack, it has latched on with its suckered mouth and remains attached. An attached leech loses it Dexterity bonus to AC (it is AC 10 while attached).\n\tAnesthetizing mucus (Ex): A leech has an anesthetic enzyme in its saliva that prevents warm-blooded creatures from feeling its bite. Creatures in the water who are bitten by a leech must make a Spot check (DC 33) or a Wilderness Lore check (DC 20) to notice being bitten.\n\tBlood drain (Ex): A giant leech drains blood, doing 1d3 points of temporary Con damage each round that it remains attached. Once it has drained 4 points of Con, it releases its hold and swims off to digest its meal. \n\tDisease (Ex): Swamp fever  bite, Fort save (DC 11), incubation period 1d4 days; damage 1d3 temporary Con.\n\tTremorsense (Ex): Leeches in the water can automatically detect the presence of anything within 30 feet that is also in contact with the water.\n\tSalt vulnerability: Leeches are instantly and fatally dehydrated by contact with salt. A handful of powdered salt sprinkled on a giant leech will cause it to detach from a victim immediately and will act upon it as a contact poison  Fortitude save (DC 25), initial and secondary damage 2d6 Con. A heavy local concentration of salt in the water will drive leeches away. \n\n\nsnapping turtle, giant (Monster Manual)\nLarge Animal (aquatic)\nHit Dice: 4d8+12 (30 hp)\nInitiative: +3 (-1 Dex, Improved Initiative)\nSpeed: 5 ft.

Each subsequent round, if its grapple check succeeds, the turtle does normal bite damage, and it is not itself considered grappled while it holds an opponent.\n\tLimb retraction (Ex): A turtle can retract its limbs and head into its shell if damaged or threatened. This effectively gives it 100% cover, though an opponent may maneuver to be able to attack it with Large piercing weapons. Doing so may well provoke an attack of opportunity from the turtle, however, given its surprisingly long neck (10-foot reach). \n\tSkills: *A turtle has natural camouflage, giving it a +8 racial bonus to Hide in heavily weedy or swampy waters. \n\n\n\nAppendix 2: Converted Magic Items\n\nLocking scroll tube: Usually crafted of ivory or bone or a precious metal, these scroll tubes are often works of art as well as useful items. They are intricately crafted with patterns that must be manipulated in a correct sequence in order to open them. An Open Locks check (DC 35) is required to open one safely, unless one knows the proper opening sequence for that particular locking scroll tube. One may break a locking scroll tube (Hardness 10 and 1 hp; Break DC 20), but this will invariably cause it to detonate for 1d8+5 points of damage to all within 10 feet, and this detonation automatically destroys the contents of the tube (magic items may make a save, at the DM’s option). The detonation effect cannot be detected nor disabled unless the locking scroll tube is dispelled or otherwise disenchanted. \nCaster Level: 5th. \nPrerequisites: Craft Wondrous Item, arcane lock, Nystul’s undetectable aura, fire trap. \nMarket Price: 750 gp\nWeight: ½ lb.\n\nPouch of holding: Aside from its size, this item is similar to a bag of holding. It weighs only five pounds when full, but actually holds up to 50 lbs of contents, and these can be of up to 12 cu. ft. volume.\nCaster Level: 6th. \nPrerequisites: Craft Wondrous Item, Leomund’s secret chest. \nMarket Price: 1,750 gp\nWeight: 1 lb. \n\n\n\nAppendix 3: Converted Pre-Rolled Characters\n\nNotes on conversion: I have added pseudonyms, family names, and/or nicknames in some cases, primarily for interest’s sake; further, I have included optional male/female names for each to accommodate characters of either gender. Each character has been given max hit points for first level and average hit points for second level, for an above-average total  some players or DMs might still wish to roll hit points anew, though. All bonuses from stats and race are already incorporated below, where applicable, but I have left skills and feats up to the player to decide. Also, I left the god/devotions of the cleric open  the player should keep his/her alignment in mind, however, when making this choice.

Connors\n\nProduct Number: 9342\nYear Published:  1992\n\nConverted from D&D to 3rd Edition D&D \nby S.H. Jones <sholdenj@uwo.ca>\n\n14 April, 2001\n\nSummary of Conversion: This adventure has been re-scaled to 3E for four characters of 3rd level.  I have made Keshute the wererat into an adept to justify the many magical effects he has instituted in Barrik’s Keep, and have added some history to the story of Barrik himself (partly to explain why no one before Keshute has entered and cleared out the keep in the years since Barrik’s death). Other incidental details or explanations appear throughout.\n\n\nThe Adventure\n\nGetting the PCs to Torlynn\n\tI haven’t changed the adventure hook (CThe Dragon’s Den” Inn), but assume that most DMs will use their own means of incorporating this adventure into their own campaigns, in any case, and will find some appropriate way to get the PCs to the village (hamlet) of Torlynn. \n\nThe Village of Torlynn\nTorlynn (hamlet): Conventional; AL NG; 80-gp limit; Assets 1,536 gp; Population 384* (currently 314); Isolated (human 95%, halfling 3%, other races 2%).\nAuthority Figures: Gustovan, male human Ari2 (Burgomaster); Father Deitrick, male human Clr3 (Pelor).  \nImportant Characters: Afhrd Hendrikson, male human War4 (sheriff); Mala Findlater, female human Rog4 (merchant and swindler); Karim of Ket, male human Wiz1 (alchemist and apothecary); Erik of Torlynn, male human Ari1 (Gustovan’s page).\nOthers: Clr1 (x3); Ftr3; Ftr1 (x2); Rog2 (x2); Rog1 (x3); Com5; Com3 (x3); Com2 (x3); Com1 (x279); Exp4; Exp3; Exp2 (x2); Exp1 (x7); War2 (x2); War1 (x19).\nNotes: The numbers above are Torlynn’s normal population; currently, however, most of the professionals (i.e., experts) and several dozen other villagers have left due to the curse (the DM should decide what services might be unavailable to PCs  or what positions may be open to those with appropriate Craft/Profession skills  as a result). \n\nInformation from Gustovan: The Burgomaster can tell the story of Barrik’s Keep for the PCs (paraphrase the story below), in addition to speaking what is in the boxed text in the module. He can also recall that Alicja, Barrik’s senior apprentice, seemed tense and agitated the night she left years ago (see below), and that there were hints from her of Barrik’s mental instability. \n\n\n* Note: For my own game, to explain the fact that nobody besides Keshute has gone into Barrik’s Keep in the years since the wizard’s death, I have made up the following two bits of background information that do not appear in the module. The rest of Keshute’s story (found on page 13 in the module, where the PCs encounter him) can be used as printed, with this CStory of Keshute” being additional flavour/background. Feel free to alter or ignore all of this in running the module, of course.\n\nThe Story of Barrik’s Keep\n\tThirty-five years ago, a wizard called Barrik built a keep near the village of Torlynn (the construction took only a couple of months, aided by the wizard’s magic). After several years, during which time he established a local reputation as a good and law-abiding man, Barrik, now commonly known as the Wizard of Newcastle, took on several apprentices from nearby villages and settlements. A number of apprentices came and went over the years. Though the wizard rarely visited Torlynn himself, his apprentices came to town regularly for supplies or, in at least two instances, to visit their families and friends. \n\tBut as the years progressed, rumours of Barrik’s increasingly strange behaviour gradually drifted to the nearby villagers; eventually, fourteen years after his arrival in the area (21 years ago now), Barrik’s first and most loyal apprentice Alicja, who was now a respected wizard in her own right, appeared in the village to say that she was leaving her master. She departed immediately with little explanation, never to be seen by the villagers again, and all contact with Barrik and his four remaining apprentices ceased that day. Though a few villagers ventured to the keep over the next year, they were never answered when they hailed the keep’s inhabitants, and the traffic soon stopped entirely. Woven into the fabric of the keep were warding spells designed to keep out unsolicited guests, and so since that time no one, until recently, has entered Barrik’s Keep. \n\nThe Story of Keshute\n\tJust over two years ago, a human adept called Keshute heard the story of Barrik. Keshute had been cursed with lycanthropy years before: his first transformation into a great, dark rat had likewise changed his mind into the twisted, blackened thing it now is. So, cruel and cunning, consumed with an insatiable thirst for power (with which he can inflict greater suffering on his enemies), he began to dream of the tomes and magical objects that surely must lie inside Barrik’s keep. He tracked down a former apprentice of Barrik, seeking a way to enter the keep. The apprentice died without giving Keshute the secret password (thanks to a geas cast by Barrik on all of his apprentices), but the wererat managed to defeat Barrik’s wards anyway. He acquired a rod of negation and, in a ritual using the rod as its focus, managed somehow to break Barrik’s spell. The rod was destroyed, but had served its purpose, for Keshute was inside the keep and would surely, he knew, find greater things.\n\n\nBarrik’s Keep\n\nCloak Room (EL 1)\nA character may make a Spot check (DC 31) to notice the dire rat(s) hiding in the refuse before disturbing the piles.\nDire rats (4): CR 1/3; SZ Small animal; HD 1d8+1; hp 5; Init +3; Spd 40 ft, climb 20 ft; AC 15 (+1 size, +3 Dex, +1 natural); Atk: bite +2 melee (1d4); SA disease; SQ low-light vision, scent; AL N; SV Fort +3, Ref +5, Will +3; Str 10, Dex 17, Con 12, Int 1, Wis 12, Chr 4. \nSkills: Climb +11, Hide +11, Spot +6. Feats: Weapon Finesse (bite). \n\tDisease (Ex): Those bitten must save (Fort DC 11), or contract disease with an incubation time of 1d3 days (1 Con/1 Dex and 1 Con). \n\tScent (Ex): Senses creatures by smell within 30 feet (60 downwind, 15 upwind; double ranges if strong smell, triple if overpowering). Track by scent with Wisdom check (DC 10).\nTreasure: A character who makes a successful Search check (DC 20) in each of the four piles of debris will find 2d10 sp scattered loosely among the rubbish.\n\n\nSitting Room (EL 2)\n\tIf the skull is damaged or destroyed, everyone in the room is affected as if by a fire trap spell: 1d4+10 points of fire damage (Reflex save (DC 13) halves).\n\tIf the candle in the skull is lit, the spirit of Barrik is attracted. The skull can no longer be harmed or destroyed, and the candle cannot be extinguished. Every other non-magical light source in the room is extinguished, and magical light sources must resist a 15th-level dispel effect or go out as well. \n\tWhen the flame gouts out of the eye-sockets (see module p.6), the spirit chooses any wizard (not a sorcerer) in the party. Regardless of alignment, he calls the wizard Cevil”  which should raise some eyebrows among fellow PCs  If there is more than one wizard present, the spirit chooses a human wizard over one of any other race; otherwise, it chooses the one with the highest Intelligence; if these are tied, he chooses the one with the highest Charisma. The chosen wizard receives a permanent +1 to Intelligence and 500 xp, and is fully healed. After this, or if no wizard is present, the skull explodes as if damaged (see above).\n* Optional note: In my game I added one extra effect here: the wizard who gains the point of Intelligence and the xp has been imbued with a piece of Barrik’s life-essence, and thus will not be attacked by the Carmour golem” in Room #2 if it animates, nor by the undead in Room #8, who somehow recognize their master (but the character gains no other power over them).\n\n\nStudy (EL 3)\n* I started with the Medium-size animated object stats for what was the Carmour golem” in the module, but have made it as tough as a Large animated object to raise the challenge level of the encounter (this due to the power of Barrik’s magic and the fact that he used enchanted armour in its construction).\n\tA successful Search check (DC 10) will determine that the stains on the rug are from blood. A successful Search check (DC 20) on the pieces of (leather) armour will determine that they were worn by furred humanoids who were hewn by a battleaxe. \n\tThe armour will animate and attack under three conditions: (i) if any character or creature enters the room who is not good-aligned; (ii) if any creature damages or attempts to damage or take apart the armour itself; or (iii) if any creature damages or attempts to damage the spellbook on the desk.\nAnimated armour: CR 3; SZ Medium-size construct; HD 4d10; hp 22; Init +0; Spd 40 ft; AC 15 (+4 natural, +1 enchantment); Atk battleaxe +5 melee (1d8+3); SQ hardness; AL N; SV Fort +1, Ref +1, Will -4; Str 16, Dex 10, Con , Int , Wis 1, Chr 1. \n\tHardness (Ex): Being constructed of plate armour, the construct has Hardness 10. \n\tConstruct: Immune to mind-influencing effects, poison, sleep, paralysis, stunning, disease, death effects, and necromantic effects, as well as any other attack that would require a Fortitude save.  Not subject to critical hits, subdual damage, ability damage, ability drain, or energy drain, nor is it at risk of death from massive damage.\n\tIf repaired (at a cost of 500 gp and requiring two weeks’ labour from a skilled armoursmith), the suit of armour will perform as a suit of +1 full plate armour for any human character. \n\tA successful Search check (DC 20, reduced to 5 if one specifically looks under the rug) is required to find the locked trapdoor (Open Locks DC 25), which opens onto the treasure. \nTreasure: 3 potions of cure light wounds, a bag containing 1000 sp, and a platinum necklace (250 gp value).\n\n\nLibrary\nAny character who searches the bookshelves and makes a successful Search check (DC 20) finds the booksafe (a strongbox shaped like a book) concealed among the other books. It is difficult to open (Open Locks DC 30), and has Hardness 5 and 1 hp and is easily broken with a heavy blow (Break DC 12). If the box is broken, the crystal key inside is likely destroyed as well: if the character breaking the box does exactly 6 hp to the box (just enough to smash it), the key survives; any more damage destroys it. Likewise, a Break check of exactly 12 breaks the box without damaging the key, while a 13 or higher will destroy it. \n\n\nDining Room\nAnyone ringing the bell or otherwise causing a great deal of noise will attract 1d4 ratlings (new monster, see Appendix 1). Note also that anyone ringing the bell throughout the rest of the adventure may draw similar attention. \nRatlings (1d4): CR ½; SZ Medium-size humanoid; HD 1d8+1; hp 5; Init +2 (Dex); Spd 30 ft; AC 14 (+2 Dex, +2 leather); Atk shortsword +2 melee (1d6); SQ darkvision 60 ft, scent; AL NE; SV Fort +1, Ref +4, Will +1; Str 10, Dex 15, Con 12, Int 8, Wis 12, Chr 7. \nSkills: Hide +8, Listen +1, Move Silently +6, Search +2, Spot +1. Feats: Weapon Finesse (shortsword). \n\tScent (Ex): Senses creatures by smell within 30 feet (60 downwind, 15 upwind; double ranges if strong smell, triple if overpowering). Track by scent with Wisdom check (DC 10).\nTreasure: The worn silver dinnerware weighs 25 lbs, but is worth 1,150 gp in total. The silver bell is a dinner bell of conjuring (new item, see Appendix 2). Each ratling carries 2d6 sp. \n\n\nTower (EL 2)\n\tThe white widow is a new monster (see Appendix 1). PCs should make a save immediately against its websong, whether or not the spider attacks immediately (it may wait in hiding for someone to enter). \nMonstrous spider, white widow: CR 2; SZ Medium-size vermin; HD 3d8+3; hp 18; Init +3; Spd 40 ft, climb 20 ft; AC 14 (+3 Dex, +1 natural); Atk bite +5 melee (1d6+1 and poison); SA poison, websong; SQ vermin; AL N; SV Fort +4, Ref +3, Will +1; Str 12, Dex 17, Con 12, Int , Wis 12, Chr 2. \nSkills: Climb +12, Hide +10*, Jump +6, Move Silently +0*, Spot +15. Feats: Weapon Finesse (bite). \n\tPoison (Ex): Bite injects cryo-toxin: Fort save (DC 14); initial damage, 1d6 Dex / secondary damage, 1d6 Dex and incapacitated (frozen  see monster description).\n\tWebsong (Su): All within 60 feet of the web when the websong occurs must make a Will save (DC 12) or become lethargic (treat as Cfatigued” [no run or charge, effective –2 penalty to Str and Dex], but this only lasts as long as the websong is heard). This is a sonic, mind-affecting charm. \n\tVermin: Immune to mind-influencing effects; all vermin have blindsight. \n\tSkills: A white widow receives a +4 racial bonus to Hide checks, a +6 racial bonus to Jump checks, and a +8 racial bonus to Spot checks. *A white widow receives a +8 competence bonus to Hide and Move Silently checks when within its webs, and, due to its coloration, a +8 racial bonus to Hide checks in areas of snow and ice.\n\tSearching the chamber for the treasure will take approximately one hour for a single individual, and a Search check (DC 15) is required to do so successfully. The amount of the treasure found is directly proportional to the relative amount of time spent searching. Note that each character beyond the first who makes a cooperative Search check (DC 10) will add a +2 bonus to the Search check of the Cprimary” searcher (see PH 62, CCombining Skill Attempts”), and will reduce the total required search time by 10 minutes. \n\tFor every 10 minutes spent searching, there is a 1 in 6 chance that 1d4 ratlings will hear something and come to investigate (use stats from Room #5). \n\tTreasure: There are 136 gold pieces scattered throughout the chamber.  \n\n\nKitchen (EL 2)\nThe two ratlings here, cleavers in hand, have the following statistics:\nRatlings, War2 (2): CR 1; SZ Medium-size humanoid; HD 2d8+2; hp 11; Init +2 (Dex); Spd 30 ft; AC 14 (+2 Dex, +2 leather); Atk cleaver +2 melee (1d4); SQ darkvision 60 ft, scent; AL NE; SV Fort +4, Ref +3, Will +1; Str 10, Dex 15, Con 12, Int 8, Wis 12, Chr 7. \nSkills: Hide +8, Jump +6, Listen +4, Move Silently +6, Search +2, Spot +4. Feats: Alertness. \n\tScent (Ex): Senses creatures by smell within 30 feet (60 downwind, 15 upwind; double ranges if strong smell, triple if overpowering). Track by scent with Wisdom check (DC 10).\nTreasure: Each ratling carries 2d6 gp.\n\n\nTomb (EL 4)\n\tThis should be a tough encounter, but note that the undead will not leave this chamber to chase fleeing PCs. If the PCs do flee the room, the undead will return to their coffins (though the ghoul, if left standing, may drag any fallen PCs who are left behind into his coffin for a snack).\nZombies (3): CR ½; SZ Medium-size undead; HD 2d12; hp 16; Init +0; Spd 30 ft; AC 11 (-1 Dex, +2 natural); Atk slam +2 melee (1d6+1); SQ undead, partial actions only; AL N; SV Fort +0, Ref -1, Will +3; Str 13, Dex 8, Con , Int , Wis 10, Chr 1. \nFeats: Toughness. \nGhoul: CR 3; SZ Medium-size undead; HD 2d12; hp 17; Init +2; Spd 30 ft; AC 14 (+2 Dex, +2 natural); Atk: 2 claws +0 (1d3 and paralysis) and bite +3 melee (1d6+1 and paralysis); SA paralysis, create spawn; SQ darkvision 60 ft, undead; AL CE; SV Fort +0, Ref +2, Will +5; Str 13, Dex 15, Con –, Int 13, Wis 14, Chr 16. \nSkills: Climb +6, Escape Artist +7, Hide +7, Intuit Direction +3, Jump +6, Listen +7, Move Silently +7, Search +6, Spot +7. Feats: Multiattack, Weapon Finesse (bite). \n\tParalysis (Su): Fort save (DC 14) or be paralyzed for 1d6+4 minutes. Elves are immune to ghoul paralysis.\n\tCreate spawn (Su): Humanoids killed and left undevoured by ghouls become ghouls under the command of their creator after 1d4 days. A protection from evil cast on the body during this period will prevent the spawn effect.  \n\tUndead: Immune to mind-influencing spells, poison, sleep, paralysis, stunning, disease, and any effect requiring a Fort save.  Not subject to critical hits, subdual damage, ability damage, energy drain, or death from massive damage.\n\tA successful Search check (DC 20) in each coffin will uncover the secret compartments. Each is trapped but contains valuable treasures, as follows:\n\tThe first coffin opened (regardless of position on the map), is trapped with a very potent necromantic gas: \nNecromantic gas trap: CR 3; no attack roll or damage (see below); Search DC 21; Disable Device DC 25. Note: This terrifying trap does no harm to the PCs directly, but releases a 20 ft by 20 ft cloud of dull greenish-grey gas enchanted with a powerful animate dead effect. Any dead bodies lying within the cloud are animated as zombies (use the stats above), which then immediately attack any living creatures. The gas dissipates quickly, and will only operate once, in the round it is first released. \nTreasure: In this coffin is a randomly generated magical item, or one of the DM’s choosing. (As a default, if you don’t have the time or inclination to roll or choose one, it is a +2 headband of intellect.)\n\tThe second coffin opened is trapped with a poisoned needle: \nPoison needle trap: CR 2; +8 melee (1, and poison  Fort DC 14, 1d6 Str / unconsciousness; Search DC 22; Disable Device DC 20. \nTreasure: In this coffin is a pouch holding 100 sp and a fancy silver dagger (50 gp). \n\tThe third coffin opened has a weak fireball trap: \nFireball trap: CR 2; as fireball (3d6); Reflex save (DC 13) halves; Search DC 20; Disable Device DC 25. Note: If the trap goes off, the treasure in this coffin is destroyed; if it is disabled, the treasure is intact. \nTreasure: In this coffin, assuming the fireball trap is disarmed, is a scroll with three cure light wounds spells on it (each cast at 3rd level).\n\tThe fourth coffin opened (regardless of position on the map), is ingeniously trapped to spray green slime onto the unwary: \nGreen slime trap: CR 4; no attack roll required; Reflex save (DC 16) avoids; Search DC 21; Disable Device DC 20. Note: A successful Reflex save means that the character has dodged the green slime, but also that any character standing behind the first must then make a Reflex save (DC 20) to avoid the slime. \nGreen Slime: CR 4; 1d6 points of temporary Con damage per round of contact; can be scraped off in first round, but must be frozen, burned, or cut away afterwards (doing damage to victim as well); 2d6 points of damage to wood or metal per round (ignores Hardness of metal); cold, heat, sunlight, or cure disease kills instantly. See DMG 117.\nTreasure: In this coffin’s compartment are a +1 small steel shield and a +1 rapier. \n\n\nAntechamber\nEmpty.\n\n\nLarder (EL 2)\nAnyone attempting to search this chamber is attacked by giant centipedes.\nMonstrous centipedes (6): CR ¼; SZ Small vermin; HD ½d8; hp 2; Init +2; Spd 30 ft; AC 14 (+1 size, +2 Dex, +1 natural); Atk bite +3 melee (1d4-3 and poison); SA poison; SQ vermin; AL N; SV Fort +2, Ref +2, Will +0; Str 5, Dex 15, Con 10, Int –, Wis 10, Cha 2. \nSkills: Climb +5, Hide +13, Spot +7. Feats: Weapon Finesse (bite).\nPoison (Ex): Fort DC 11; 1d2 Dex / 1d2 Dex.\nVermin: Immune to mind-influencing effects; all vermin have blindsight. \nSkills: Monstrous centipedes receive a +4 racial bonus to Climb, Hide, and Spot checks.\nIf the PCs search the larder after the centipedes are dispatched, they can find 7 days’ rations that is still edible. Purify food and drink allows the PCs to reclaim up to an additional 14 days’ rations from the remainder of the spoiled food. \n\n\nWine Cellar\nThe PCs may rest here without threat for up to four hours, after that time, roll 1d6 every hour. On a 1, a gang of ratlings discovers the PCs (or perhaps the party is ratted out).\nRatlings (1d4+1): CR ½; SZ Medium-size humanoid; HD 1d8+1; hp 5; Init +2 (Dex); Spd 30 ft; AC 14 (+2 Dex, +2 leather); Atk shortsword +2 melee (1d6); SQ darkvision 60 ft, scent; AL NE; SV Fort +1, Ref +4, Will +1; Str 10, Dex 15, Con 12, Int 8, Wis 12, Chr 7. \nSkills: Hide +8, Listen +1, Move Silently +6, Search +2, Spot +1. Feats: Weapon Finesse (shortsword). \n\tScent (Ex): Senses creatures by smell within 30 feet (60 downwind, 15 upwind; double ranges if strong smell, triple if overpowering). Track by scent with Wisdom check (DC 10).\n\n\nBallroom (EL 3)\n* I have altered the boxed description of this room because of the presence of the gelatinous cube, which would keep the chamber very clean.\nThis great room, once likely an elegant ballroom, is now bare. Two exquisite chandeliers still hang from the ceiling, but they are the only trace of the chamber’s former use. Nothing of a dining hall remains, no chairs, no table, no hangings  all has been stripped clean, though there are a few smallish piles of debris and refuse here and there throughout the room. Despite the chill, rats and other tiny vermin scurry and scuttle about, and a few bloated insects buzz slowly to and fro. \nThe debris is what has been left behind  literally  by the gelatinous cube. Scattered among these piles are various and sundry types of bones, as well as a few coins and perhaps even some magical items or other items of value picked up in the cube’s travels (see Treasure). \n\tBe sure to have the party roll to spot the gelatinous cube if or when they enter and, if they have insufficient light, be sure to give them appropriate penalties (see DMG 60, CSpotting Difficulty”).\nGelatinous cube: CR 3; SZ Huge ooze; HD 4d10+36; hp 50; Init –5 (Dex); Spd 15 ft; AC 3 (-2 size, -5 Dex); Atk slam +1 melee (1d6+4 and 1d6 acid); Face 10 ft by 10 ft; Reach 10 ft; SA engulf, paralysis, acid; SQ blindsight, transparency, electricity immunity, ooze; AL N; SV Fort +5, Ref -4, Will -4; Str 10, Dex 1, Con 19, Int , Wis 1, Chr 1. \n\tEngulf (Ex): Although it moves slowly, a gelatinous cube can mow down Large or smaller opponents as a standard action. It cannot make a slam attack in a round when it engulfs. The gelatinous cube merely has to move over the spaces occupied by opponents, affecting as many as its movement allows it to cover. Opponents can make attacks of opportunity against the cube, but if they do so they are not entitled to a saving throw. Those who do not make AoO’s must succeed at a Reflex save (DC 13) to avoid being engulfed; on a success, they are pushed back or aside (player’s choice) as the cube moves forward. Engulfed creatures are subject to the cube’s paralysis and acid, and are considered to be grappled and trapped within its body.\n\tParalysis (Ex): Gelatinous cubes secrete an anaesthetizing slime. A target hit by its slam or engulf attack must succeed at a Fort save (DC 16) or be paralyzed for 3d6 rounds. The cube can automatically engulf a paralyzed creature. \n\tAcid (Ex): A gelatinous cube’s acid does not harm metal or stone.\n\tTransparent (Ex): Gelatinous cubes are hard to see, even under ideal conditions, and it takes a successful Spot check (DC 15) to notice one. Creatures who fail to see a cube and walk into it are automatically engulfed.\nOoze: Immune to mind-influencing effects (charms, compulsions, phantasms, patterns, and morale effects), poison, sleep, stunning, and polymorphing; not subject to critical hits or flanking. \n\tFor each minute spent searching the inside of the cube or the debris in the room, a character may make a Search check; the Search may uncover some item of value or interest, as follows (by Search DC):\nSearch Roll\tResult\n       31+\tThe character finds a minor magical item (roll or DM’s choice). This result may \noccur only once per character; treat further rolls of 31+ as a result of 26-30 instead.\nThe character finds an art object or valuable item of some kind (1d10x10 gp).\n    21-25\tThe character finds a handful of coins (1d10-1 gp, 2d8 sp).\nThe character finds a random object: roll on Table 46: Dungeon DressingMinor Features and Furnishings (DMG 113).\n11-15\tThe character disturbs and is attacked by 1d4 dire rats.\nDire rats (1d4): CR 1/3; SZ Small animal; HD 1d8+1; hp 5; Init +3; Spd 40 ft, climb 20 ft; AC 15 (+1 size, +3 Dex, +1 natural); Atk: bite +2 melee (1d4); SA disease; SQ low-light vision, scent; AL N; SV Fort +3, Ref +5, Will +3; Str 10, Dex 17, Con 12, Int 1, Wis 12, Chr 4. \nSkills: Climb +11, Hide +11, Spot +6. Feats: Weapon Finesse (bite). \n\tDisease (Ex): Those bitten must save (Fort DC 11), or contract disease with an incubation time of 1d3 days (1 Con/1 Dex and 1 Con). \n\tScent (Ex): Senses creatures by smell within 30 feet (60 downwind, 15 upwind; double ranges if strong smell, triple if overpowering). Track by scent with Wisdom check (DC 10).\n     1-10\tThe character encounters nothing except perhaps some rats or other vermin.\n\n\nBarrik’s Chambers (EL 1)\n\tIf any character looks under the bed, the beetle hiding there spits acid into his or her face; given the awkward position required to look under the bed, a PC doing so gets a –4 circumstance penalty to his or her Reflex save to avoid the beetle’s acid. Further, any attacks against the beetle while it remains under the bed are at a –4 penalty and can only be made with piercing weapons. \nGiant spitting beetle (new monster): CR 1; SZ Tiny vermin; HD 1d8+1; hp 8; Init +1; Spd 20 ft; AC 16 (+2 size, +1 Dex, +3 natural); Atk bite -1 melee (1d4-3); SA spit acid; SQ vermin; AL N; SV Fort +3, Ref +1, Will +0; Str 4, Dex 12, Con 12, Int –, Wis 10, Cha 8. \nSkills: Listen +4, Spot +4.\n\tSpit acid (Ex): When attacked or disturbed, the giant spitting beetle can Cspit” a 10-foot stream of acid at an opponent once per round. The target must make a Reflex save (DC 11) or take 1d4 points of damage; a successful save halves damage. If the save is failed by 5 or more, the target also suffers one point of permanent Charisma loss.\n\tVermin: Immune to mind-influencing effects; all vermin have blindsight. \n\tNote: The PCs should gain double xp for this particular beetle (advanced HD).\n\tIf the beetle is killed or ignored, the PCs can search the rest of the room. A successful Search check (DC 13) will uncover the strongbox in the desk; the box can be opened only with the crystal key from Room #4 or by dispelling Barrik’s ward (no easy task, as it is a 15th-level effect), which makes it impervious to damage or breakage. \nTreasure: In the strongbox are a +1 dagger, a wand of detect magic (34 charges; casts at 6th level), and a bag of holding (type I), as well as a pouch holding 5 small precious stones (2d6x10 gp each) and a tiny wooden box with 50 pp in it. \n\n\nStorage\nThere are no salvageable spell components here.\n\n\nLaboratory (EL 5)\n* I have made Keshute into a variant adept, identical to that in the DMG but with only arcane spells (and thus Charisma based; he gets mage armour and daze, for example, which allowed him to make his two magic items). His two items, crafted using the bones of defeated enemies and various ingredients found here in Barrik’s laboratory, are described in Appendix 2.\n\tKeshute will attempt to speak with the party (he is quite charming, in fact), as described in the module (p.13), trying to set them up so that he and his ratling allies can catch them off-guard. If attacked, he blows a silver whistle to summon from 1-4 ratlings. Whether he tricks the party or not, however, the DM should decide how many ratlings arrive to aid him, depending on how the party is faring at this point and whether Keshute may be enough of a challenge himself. \nKeshute, male wererat adept 4: CR 4; SZ Medium-size shapechanger; HD 4d8+4; hp 22; Init +4; Spd 30 ft, or 40 ft as rat; AC 19 (+4 Dex, +3 natural, +2 crown), AC 20 as rat; Atk light mace +6 (1d6 and daze (Will DC 12)) and bite +4 melee (1d4 and curse of lycanthropy); SA spells; SQ darkvision 60 ft, alternate form, rat empathy, scent, damage reduction 15/silver; SV Fort +5, Ref +8, Will +6; AL LE; Str 11, Dex 18, Con 12, Int 12, Wis 14, Cha 14.\nSkills: Climb +15, Concentration +8, Craft (sculpting) +8, Hide +8 (+12 as rat), Knowledge (arcana) +8, Listen +12, Move Silently +7, Search +9, Spellcraft +8, Spot +12, Swim +12.

Changing from any one of his three forms to another is a standard action, and heals hit points as if Keshute had rested a full day (8 hp). If slain, he will revert to human form. \n\tRat empathy (Ex): Keshute can communicate and empathize with any rat or dire rat. This gives him a +4 racial bonus to influence such creatures as well. \n\tScent (Ex): Senses creatures by smell within 30 feet (60 downwind, 15 upwind; double ranges if strong smell, triple if overpowering). Track by scent with a Wisdom check (DC 10).\n\tPossessions: +2 bone crown (new item), bone sceptre of stunning (new item), 10 pp.\nRatlings: CR ½; SZ Medium-size humanoid; HD 1d8+1; hp 5; Init +2 (Dex); Spd 30 ft; AC 14 (+2 Dex, +2 leather); Atk shortsword +2 melee (1d6); SQ darkvision 60 ft, scent; AL NE; SV Fort +1, Ref +4, Will +1; Str 10, Dex 15, Con 12, Int 8, Wis 12, Chr 7. \nSkills: Hide +8, Listen +1, Move Silently +6, Search +2, Spot +1.

Track by scent with Wisdom check (DC 10).\n\tThe throne of ice cannot be melted or broken by the PCs, nor will they able to chip more than a few tiny particles away from it; the sword buried in it cannot be budged. The throne is in fact an ice golem, but will not arise unless Elladin, the elf in the next chamber, retrieves his sword from it.\n* Using Elladin’s sword as a focus, along with a potent magical tome about constructs that he found in Barrik’s laboratory (the tome is now destroyed  Keshute could not bear the thought of another using it), Keshute constructed an ice golem. This accomplishment would have been far beyond him if not for the knowledge provided by the tome and the power provided by the sword; now, he cannot control it in any way, and it will arise only if Elladin’s sword is drawn from it, as stated above. When it does arise, it is injured already from the sword being withdrawn (use the hit points in parentheses below). If it is defeated, the curse on Torlynn Valley is lifted. \nIce golem: CR 3; SZ Large construct; HD 5d10; hp 36(18); Init -1; Spd 30 ft (can’t run); AC 18 (-1 size, -1 Dex, +10 natural); Atk slam +6 melee (1d8+4); Reach 10 ft; SA numbing touch; SQ construct, damage reduction 5/+1, density, cold subtype; AL N; SV Fort +1, Ref +0, Will +1; Str 17, Dex 9, Con , Int , Wis 11, Chr 1. \n\tNumbing touch (Ex): Anyone hit by an ice golem in combat must make a Fortitude save (DC 12) or take a point of temporary Dex damage from the numbing cold that surrounds it. Creatures protected by endure elements and the like are immune to this effect.\n\tConstruct: Immune to mind-influencing effects, poison, sleep, paralysis, stunning, disease, death effects, and necromantic effects, as well as any other attack that would require a Fortitude save.  Not subject to critical hits, subdual damage, ability damage, ability drain, or energy drain, nor is it at risk of death from massive damage.\n\tDensity (Ex): Due to its great density and hardness, an ice golem takes only half damage from piercing and slashing attacks (figured before damage resistance).\nCold subtype (Ex): Cold immunity; double damage from fire on failed save.\nTreasure: The only treasure in the chamber is Elladin’s silver longsword, CFianharvhin.” It is a mere +1 longsword in the hands of one who has no elven blood, but for elves it acts as a +2 frost weapon. In the hands of Elladin or one of his direct bloodline, however, it gains its full powers: it is a +4 intelligent, icy burst, dancing longsword (Int 13, Wis 12, Chr 10, Ego 16; AL CG) that has empathy and grants continuous endure element (heat) while wielded; further, it can always be summoned to the hand of one of Elladin’s blood if it is within sight  if currently held in another’s hand or affixed somehow, Elladin may make a Will check (DC varies, but usually opposes a Strength check) to have it pull free and return to his hand regardless. \n\n\nCell\nIn this chamber, frozen by the white widow’s cryotoxin, are four elves. They appear dead and can be roused only by great heat or certain magics (see the white widow in Appendix 1: CNew Creatures” for an explanation of cryotoxin’s effects). \n\tOnce awakened, they are disabled (numb, at 0 hp, and unable to fight  see DMG 84), and need the PCs’ assistance. This condition will wear off with time or with magical healing, if any is immediately available, but even with magical healing the elves will likely still be in no condition to fight for a few days at least. Note also that they are all at low temporary Dex scores due to the effects of the white widow poison. \nElladin Silvercrest, male elf Ftr2/Wiz3: CR 5; SZ Medium humanoid; HD 2d10+2+3d4+3; hp 21(0*); Init +2; Spd 30 ft; AC 12 (-2 Dex*, +4 chain shirt); Atk: none (disabled*); SA spells; SQ low-light vision, elf traits; AL CG; SV Fort +5, Ref +2, Will +3; Str 14, Dex 15 (6*), Con 12, Int 16, Wis 11, Chr 14.\nSkills: Alchemy +6, Appraise +6, Concentration +9, Diplomacy +5, Knowledge (arcana) +9, Listen +2, Ride +6, Scry +5, Search +7, Spellcraft +9, Spot +2.

The golem costs 10,000 gp to create; assembling the body requires a successful Craft (sculpting) check (DC 15). The ritual requires an 8th-level caster who can cast either arcane or divine spells. Completing the ritual drains 500 xp from the creator and requires bull’s strength, polymorph other, protection from elements, and wall of ice. \n\n\nRatlings\nMedium-Size Humanoid\nHit Dice: 1d8+1 (5 hp)\nInitiative: +2 (Dex)\nSpeed: 30 ft.\nAC: 14 (+2 Dex, +2 leather)\nAttacks: Shortsword +2 melee; bite +0 melee; or sling +2 ranged\nDamage: Shortsword 1d6; bite 1d4; sling 1d4\nFace/Reach: 5 ft by 5 ft. / 5 ft.\nSpecial Qualities: Darkvision 60 ft., scent\nSaves: Fort +1, Ref +4, Will +1\nAbilities: Str 10, Dex 15, Con 12, Int 8, Wis 12, Chr 7\nSkills: Hide +8, Listen +1, Move Silently +6, Search +2, Spot +1\nFeats: Weapon Finesse (shortsword)\nClimate/Terrain: Cold or temperate land and underground\nOrganization: Solitary, pair, gang (2-5), band (6-60 plus 100% non-combatants plus 1 3rd-level sergeant per 20 adults and one leader of 4th6th level), or tribe (20-200 plus 150% non-combatants plus 1 3rd-level sergeant per 20 adults, 1 or 2 lieutenants of 4th or 5th level, and one leader of 4th6th level, many rats, and 10-20 dire rats; underground lairs also may have 2-5 wererats)\nCR: ½\nTreasure: Standard\nAlignment: Usually neutral evil\nAdvancement: By character class\n\tRatlings are slightly shorter than humans (averaging 5 to 5½ feet tall) and are lithe and agile. They appear much like rat-faced humans, and their fur varies in colour as does that of rats. \nCombat\nRatlings tend to favour stealth and subterfuge to direct confrontation, but, if cornered, can be savage. They are cunning and often use traps and terrain to good advantage, and are known to prepare excellent ambushes. \n\tScent (Ex): Senses creatures by smell within 30 feet (60 downwind, 15 upwind; double ranges if strong smell, triple if overpowering). Track by scent with Wisdom check (DC 10).\nRatling Society\nRatling leaders are as often as not wererats, but particularly ill-natured ratlings have also been known to serve vampires and other such foul masters. \n\tA band or tribe of ratlings typically includes as many noncombatant young as there are adults. Their lairs are generally quite effectively defended by traps and guerrilla tactics. Ratlings will take slaves, and any lair may have 1 humanoid slave for every 10 to 20 adult ratlings.\n\tRatlings speak their own tongue, though 1 in 10 will speak rudimentary Common, and are generally on very friendly terms with wererats. They dislike goblinoids and will not cooperate with them. \nRatling Characters\n\tA ratling’s favoured class is rogue; leaders are often rogues or rogue/warriors, though fighters are not unheard of among them. Ratling clerics usually worship Erythnul. \n\n\nvermin  giant beetle, spitting\nTiny Vermin\nHit Dice: ½d8+1 (3 hp)\nInitiative: +1 (Dex)\nSpeed: 20 ft. \nAC: 16 (+2 size, +1 Dex, +3 natural)\nAttacks: Bite -3 melee\nDamage: Bite 1d4-3\nFace/Reach: 2½ ft by 2½ ft. / 0 ft.\nSpecial Attacks: Spit acid\nSpecial Qualities: Vermin\nSaves: Fort +3, Ref +1, Will +0\nAbilities: Str 4, Dex 12, Con 12, Int , Wis 10, Chr 8\nSkills: Listen +4, Spot +4\nClimate/Terrain: Temperate or cold land and underground\nOrganization: Cluster (2-5), or swarm (6-11)\nCR: ½\nTreasure: None\nAlignment: Always neutral\nAdvancement: 1-3 HD (Tiny)\n\tThe giant spitting beetle is a close relative of the giant bombardier beetle, but is considerably smaller and is adapted to colder climates.

They typically grow to be about 4 feet in body-length, though much larger specimens have been noted. \nCombat\nBeing primarily hunters, white widows rely on their senses and their hiding and leaping abilities to capture prey. However, they have also perfected a special type of web-design that results in a strange whistling Cwebsong” as wind passes through the web. Their webs are rigid and fragile, having Hardness 2 and 5 hp per 5-foot square area. \n\tAnyone bitten by a white widow must make a save or freeze solid. Frozen characters are still alive, but are totally incapacitated and might easily be mistaken for dead. The spider stores its prey frozen in this way rather than wrapping victims in webs as other spiders often do. \n\tPoison (Ex): Bite injects cryotoxin, Fort save (DC 14); initial damage, 1d6 Dex / secondary, 1d6 Dex and incapacitated (frozen solid). Note that those Cfrozen” by the poison appear dead, and only a Search check (DC 20) or a Heal check (DC 15) will determine otherwise. Frozen characters can only be revived by exposure to great heat (such as that from a bonfire or a heat metal spell), though an endure elements or the like cast before freezing has set in will prevent the freezing effect; a delay poison or neutralize poison is necessary to avoid the Dexterity damage, however. \n\tWebsong (Su): As long as there is some air movement, all within 60 feet of the webs will hear the websong and must make a Will save (DC 12) or become lethargic (treat as fatigued, DMG 84, but only while the song is heard). This is a sonic, mind-affecting charm. \n\tSkills: A white widow receives a +4 racial bonus to Hide checks, a +6 racial bonus to Jump checks, and a +8 racial bonus to Spot checks. *A white widow receives a +8 competence bonus to Hide and Move Silently checks when within its webs, and, due to its coloration, a +8 racial bonus to Hide checks in areas of snow and ice.\n\n\n\nAppendix 2: New Magic Items\n\nBone crown: This spined crown functions essentially as bracers of armour, but is crafted instead from a fallen enemy’s skull (in fact, Keshute’s is crafted from the skull of one of Barrik’s former apprentices), with spines made from several ribs or other small bones. Such items can only be crafted up to a maximum of +3 protection, unless rare bones from powerful creatures are used in their construction. \nCaster Level: 4th. \nPrerequisites: Craft Wondrous Item, mage armour, Craft (sculpting) check (DC 20) required, creator’s class level must be twice that of bonus placed in the crown. \nMarket Price: 1,000 gp (+1); 4,000 gp (+2); 9,000 (+3).\n\nBone sceptre of stunning: Though Keshute calls this item a Csceptre,” it is really a light mace constructed of several heavy bones joined together with precious metals. Opponents struck by the sceptre must, in addition to taking damage, make a Will save (DC 12) or be stunned for one round. \nCaster Level: 3rd. \nPrerequisites: Craft Magic Arms and Armour, daze, Craft (sculpting) check (DC 15) required. \nMarket Price: 1,350 gp.\n\nDinner bell of conjuring: When one first rings this bell, it will cause a fine meal to spring into being. The food created will be exactly as desired by the person ringing the bell, reflecting his or her own tastes. Thereafter, to use the bell the character must state aloud what food he or she wishes and then ring the bell vigorously. When its last chime fades away, the meal appears before the ringer. The food appears in containers appropriate to its nature (soup in a bowl, tea in a cup, etc.) and with cutlery, but the dishes and utensils vanish when the meal is eaten. If the food is not consumed within a half-hour, it fades away. The bell may be rung any number of times, but will produce food only three times per day. \nCaster Level: 4th. \nPrerequisites: Craft Wondrous Item, create food and water. \nMarket Price: 1,250 gp.\n\n", "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMicrosoft Word - MI2RitesofPassage.doc\n\n\nRITES OF PASSAGE \n\n© 2001 MIDGARD On-Line d20 Adventures: http://www.matantisi.com/aquerra/midgard/midgard.htm  Page   1  \n\nRites of Passage \n \n\nThe Unkindest Cut of All \nwritten by Osvaldo Oyola Ortega \n\n \n“Rites of Passage” is an Interlude for a party of 4 to 6 1st-level characters (or alternately, 4-8 characters \nwith NPC classes of levels 1 to 2).  This is adventure is meant to introduce new characters to their first \nreal combat encounter… and learn that all is not always what it seems. \n \n� Magic Items     ω  Towns     ν  Non-player Characters (NPCs)     τ  Traps     υ Objects     µ Monsters \n \n \nAdventure Overview \n \n\nWhile passing through or near to the town \nof Cutter Jack’s the party discovers a standing \nbounty on the ears of goblins; left ears that is.  \nThe catch is that the bounty has been around \nfor generations as a way to curb the local \ngoblin population, and the goblin tribe (the Na-\nSor) adopted the custom of removing \nthe left ear of adolescents when they \nreach adulthood as a sign of defiance \nagainst their human oppressors.  The \nlaw regarding the bounty was never \nchanged, and the goblins population \nhas not risen sufficiently in the past \nfew generations for the monsters to \nbe a threat.  So, it was forgotten \nexcept for a few moldy signs and \nsome mischievous locals. \n \n\nWhen new-comers come through \nor nearby town, the locals tend to \nbring up the goblin bounty to send the \nwould-be bounty collectors on a wild-\ngoose chase.  Even if they find and kill \ngoblins, the left ear has already been \nremoved, making it worthless in terms of profit.   \n \n\nHowever, if and when the PCs go hunting \ngoblins they will stumble upon the very \nceremony of coming of age where these ears \n\nare removed, and in interrupting the goblin rite \nof passage, instigate their own. \n \nBeginning the Adventure \n \n\nThe adventure can begin one of two ways \n(or a DM could incorporate both): \n\n \n\nο While traveling through the hilly \nwoods south of Cutter Jack’s the party \nis startled by a deer being chased by \ntwo hunters. If you want to get your \nplayers into the right mood with a few \nskill checks, you could give Druid or \nRanger PCs a chance to calm the \ndeer, or for others characters to down \nit. Whatever they do, the two hunters \n(David and Andre) explain that the \ndeer was startled by the sound of the \nparty coming – and they hesitated \n(rather than chase right away) afraid \nthat the party was a group of goblins.  \nIf the party inquires about the goblins, \nthe hunters inform them about the \nbounty for goblin ears: 1 piece of gold \nper left ear. They add that it has to be \n\nleft so that people don’t try to cash in twice.  \nSuch bounties can be collected in at the town \nguardhouse.  They give directions to the ravine \nand mine shaft. If the party enters town, locals \ncan confirm what the two hunters said.  \n\n \n\nAdventure Area\nω \n \n\nThe town of Cutter\nJack’s itself is not\ndetailed in this\nadventure, and the\nname is only provided\nas an easy reference.\nThis “interlude” is\nmeant to be easily\nslipped into a\nreasonably secluded\narea away from\ngeneral civilization\nwith a nearby hilly\narea. \n\n\n\nRITES OF PASSAGE \n \n\n© 2001 MIDGARD On-Line d20 Adventures: http://www.matantisi.com/aquerra/midgard/midgard.htm  2  \n\nν   Andre – Human Male Expert 2:  CR ½  Medium-\nsized humanoid (6’ tall)  HD: 2d6+4  hps: 13  Init: +1,  \nSpd: 30 ft., AC: 7 (leather + dex) At: +1  (+2 melee or \nranged)   Al: N   SV: Fort: +2   Ref: +1,   Will: +3;  \n\nStr: 12,  Dex: 13,  Con: 15  Int: 10  Wis: 11,  Cha: 10 \nSkills: Climb (+3), Craft, Leatherworking (+4), Handle \n\nAnimal (+3), Hide (+5), Intuit Direction (+2), Knowledge – \nNature (+3), Move Silently (+4), Profession – Hunter (+5), \nSpot (+3), Swim (+3), Wilderness Lore (+5) \n\nFeats: Tracking \nSQ: Suffers –4 attack penalty with bow and axe. \nPossessions: Hand axe, short bow (12 arrows),  \n\nskinning knife, dagger  \n \n\nν   David – Human Male Expert 2 : CR ½  Medium-\nsized humanoid (6’ tall)  HD: 2d6+4  hps: 13  Init: +1,  \nSpd: 30 ft., AC: 6 (leather + dex) At: +1  (+2 melee or \nranged)   Al: N   SV: Fort: +2   Ref: +1,   Will: +3;  \n\nStr: 13,  Dex: 14,  Con: 12  Int: 11  Wis: 13,  Cha: 9 \nSkills: Climb (+3), Craft, Leatherworking (+4), Handle \n\nAnimal (+3), Hide (+5), Intuit Direction (+2), Search (+3), \nMove Silently (+4), Profession – Hunter (+5), Spot (+3), \nSwim (+3), Wilderness Lore (+5) \n\nFeats: Martial Weapon (short bow) \nSQ: Suffers –4 attack penalty with axe. \nPossessions: Hand axe, short bow (12 arrows), \n\nskinning knife, dagger \n \n\nο The second option is as follows: after \ncoming into town to re-supply, the PCs come \nupon an old posting that reads:  \n\n \n\n \n \n\nAsking locals about town will confirm this.  \nThey can give directions to the PCs towards \nthe “old mine” as they call it. \n \n \n \n \n\n \nThe Ravine and the Old Mine \n\n \nThe place the locals refer to as “the old \n\nmine” was once the goblin tribe’s lair.  \nHowever, they were forced to abandon the \nplace when the locals discovered that copper \ncould be found there and the old bounty first \nbegan.  While the goblins have found another \nplace to lair that they prefer, they still see this \nspot as a sacred part of their homeland and \nreturn for important ceremonies like the coming \nof age ritual. \n\nThe ravine itself is surrounded by a layer of \nbrush that gives (25%) cover to anyone at the \ntop.  The western side is a steep wall of black \nstone (climb DC 25), while the east side \n(above the mine shaft) is a craggy hill of \nplateaus that while covered in small shrubs \nprovide no cover (climb DC 15).   The southern \nside is much less of a steep slope covered in \nthorny vines that (painfully) aid climbing (climb \nDC 0). The natural erosion of the stone on the \nnorthern side has created a ramp down to the \nravine floor (see map). \n\nThe floor of the ravine is a fine gravel, that \nkicks up into dust easily. \n\n \nThe following text includes a description for \n\ncharacters that sneak up to the edge of the \nravine to spy on the action below: \n\n \nThe moonlight reveals a strange ritual.  \n\nLarge ruddy-skinned goblins in studded leather \narmor flank a black altar stone.  They appear \nimpassive, and wield spears.  Behind the altar \nare five apparently young goblins in two rows.  \nThey are armored as well, but not armed.  Just \noff to the side and front of the altar stone is a \nline of 5 more young goblins.  They are armed \nand hold spears upright at their sides, but have \ntheir hands up to the left side of their head.  \nImmediately before the altar is a squat goblin \ndressed in wolf-hides.  Around his neck is a \nnecklace, which holds a wolf-skull, and at his \nside is a vicious-looking club. \n \n\nAs you watch, a young goblin steps up onto \nthe black stone and kneels before the wolf-skin \ngarbed one.  This goblin begins to speak some \nwords and look to the sky.  He punches the \ngoblin twice in the chest, who then growls and \nbows his head.  The leader of the ceremony \nthen takes the young goblin’s head in his \nhands and there is a quick jerking motion.  The \nperformer of the ceremony steps back, as the \nyoung goblin steps off the stone dazedly.  He \nsteps over to one of the flanking warriors and \nhis handed a spear.  He then takes his place in \n\n\n\nRITES OF PASSAGE \n \n\n© 2001 MIDGARD On-Line d20 Adventures: http://www.matantisi.com/aquerra/midgard/midgard.htm  3  \n\nline with the others holding their hands to their \nheads \n \nIt is wholly possible that the game-master may \nhave to abridge or alter the above description \nbased on the character’s actions.  The intensity \nof the ceremony makes it so that all involved \nsuffer a –4 circumstance penalty to spot or \nlisten checks.  However, Gar-wog’s (the goblin \nsorcerer) familiar (a bat) is hanging in nearby \ntree, near the north end of the ravine.  If the \nparty approaches from this side the bat will \nsurely see and/or hear them, unless the party \nis taking precautions to be stealthy. \n \n\nµ Bat Familiar – Diminutive animal, HD: ¼ d8  Hps: 2,  \nInitiative: +2 (dex), Speed: 5 ft., fly 40 ft (good), AC: 16 \n(+4 size, +2 dex), Attacks: Nil, Damage: Nil  SQ: \nBlindsight   Saves: Fort: +2, Ref +4, Will: +2   \nAbilities: Str: 1 (-5) Dex: 15 (+2), Con: 10, Int: 2 (-5), Wis: \n14 (+2), Cha: 4 (-4)   \nSkills: Listen: +9,  Move Silently: +6, Spot: +9  \n \n\nThe bat will immediately fly to within range to \nalert its master.  Allow the PCs in the area a \nspot check to notice the bat, it will be moving at \nfour times its speed to get to its master. \n\n \nOnce the goblin warlock is alerted to the \n\nPCs’ presence, he will send the two flanking \nwarriors up the stone ramp to engage them, \nand yell at the dazed goblins who have had \ntheir ears removed to take some action.  He \nwill do this as moving to place the ramp wall \nagainst his back to avoid being a target for \nspells or missile fire and remain there until all \nhis goblins have engaged and then support \nthem with spells.  He will send out his bat to \ncircle above to give him reports on where PCs \nmight be hidden and then yell instructions to \nhis warriors.   \n\n \nThe “uncut” goblins will stand about \n\nconfused for a round and then begin to run \ntowards the southern end of the ravine and \nclimb out in order to escape.  As they are \nofficially not “adults” until their ear is cut, they \nare not allowed to take part in combat. \n\n \nThe “cut” goblins will stand dazed in pain for \n\n1d3 rounds, or until attacked. \n \n\nµ Goblin Warriors (2) – Small Humanoid (goblinoid)  \nWarrior 2  HD:2d8  hps: 13 each  CR: ½   Initiative: +1 \n(Dex)  Spd: 30 ft.

He wears a tarnished gold signet \nring (worth 80 gps; see below), and carries his spell \ncomponents in a belt pouch.  He also wields a club and \ncarries ceremonial knife made of an ox bone.  It is fragile \nand dull and only does 1d4-1 (minimum 1) points of \ndamage when used in melee, a bag of goblin ears (a \nnumber equal to the “cut” goblins). \n \n Gar-Wog will remain behind his goblin \nwarriors and cast spells from there, casting \nacid spittle and then moving in to spit it and \nmoving away.  He will also try to use Daze on \nobvious fighters and his warriors will gang up \non that character for that round.  If forced to \nflee he heads first towards the southern end of \nthe ravine to climb away.  If this way is \nblocked, he heads to the mine to hide and then \nuse Disappear and try to sneak past the party. \n \nPoints of Interest \n \n1. The Black Stone: This black square stone \nobviously was brought here from somewhere \nelse, but examination of how it lies will tell an \nobservant individual that it has been here quite \nsome time.  It can be pried out of the gravelly \ndirt, but weighs 200 lbs.  It is 1½ feet tall, by 2 \nfeet wide, by 3 feet long.  It is stained in fresh \ngoblin blood. \n \n2. The Old Mine:  The entrance is about ten \nfeet high and 15 feet wide.  Any light from \noutside reaches about 20’ in and then visibility \nbecomes a problem.   Anyone using the \ntracking feat should be able to tell (DC 10) that \nno one has walked here in quite some time. \n \n3. The Break Room: This room once had a \ndoor, which now hangs splintering from one \nrusty hinge.  Read the following aloud to your \nplayers: \n \n This dusty room carved of the earth is filled \nwith broken furniture and rubble.  There are \nhooks by the entrance and in the low ceiling for \nlanterns, though none are there now.  The \nfurniture appears to have been wooden \nbenches and tables.  There are also shards of \ncrockery and bits of metal around. The rough-\nhewn walls are slick with moisture that runs \n\ndown from the ceiling, and that has smeared \nthe now illegible scrawls on the walls. \n \n This was once a break room for miners.  \nThere is nothing of value left here, as vagrants, \nvandals and other questionable creatures and \npeople have stayed here over the years.  The \ngraffiti was painted by children, but in its \nsmeared state could be mistaken for arcane \nsymbols.  In reality it calls the local lord’s \nmother a kobold. \n \n4. The Dark Mine Shaft \n \nRead aloud: \n \n The tunnel slopes downward in the form of \nbroad steps to a 20’ x 20’ shaft that goes \nstraight down into the darkness.  Two rusty \nrings are set into the ceiling, one with a \nsplintering wooden pulley, with a bit of frayed \nrope still hanging off.  Water drips soundlessly, \nplummeting into the abyss with an echoing \nploop below. \n \n The mine does not really play into this \nInterlude.  The easiest way to handle it is to \nhave the lower mine levels be flooded.  The \nsurface of the water should be 60’ down, and \nshould go down at least another 20’ to \ndiscourage exploration.  Alternately, the DM \nmay decide to attach this encounter to some to \nsome other related or unrelated adventure \ninvolving a copper mine.  The walls of the shaft \nare dangerously slick (DC 30). \n \nEnding the Adventure \n \n The Interlude basically ends when the \nencounter is finished, with either all the goblins \nfleeing or being soundly defeated.  If the PCs \nretrieve the bag of ears, the town authorities \nwill be very surprised to see the goblin ears, \nbut will be obligated to pay the bounty.   \n \nContinuing the Adventure \n \n Of course the nature of this interlude \nmakes it so that the GM can expand upon it in \nmany different ways.  Below are some \nsuggestions: \n \n\nο The Signet Ring: The signet ring with a \nfancy “S” (or whatever letter works for the \ncampaign setting) belonged to a long lost \nmember of a local noble family that will give a \n100 gps reward for its return (a local pawn-\nbroker would be able to identify it as such).  \nThis good deed could gain the party \n\n\n\nRITES OF PASSAGE \n \n\n© 2001 MIDGARD On-Line d20 Adventures: http://www.matantisi.com/aquerra/midgard/midgard.htm  5  \n\nemployment from this family.  This could easily \nbe linked with the “armor” plot point below. \n \n\nο The Studded Leather Armor:  When and \nif the characters examine the armor the goblins \nare wearing they find it is of very fine quality \n(just short of masterwork).  Where did these \ngoblins get such access to such fine armor?  \nThe GM could develop a conspiracy with \nanother town or nation who is helping to arm \nthe goblins in order to weaken their neighbor.  \nThe non-serious attitude towards the goblins \nthat locals have would mean that an attack by \nthem would be unexpected and quite effective.  \nPerhaps that is why so many young goblins \nare being initiated. \n \n\nο The Old Mine: What is in the old mine?  \nWhy was it abandoned?  Why have the goblins \nnot returned to their home?  Perhaps it is \nmerely flooded, or perhaps something more \nfrightening and powerful live within.   This \ncould be a dropped clue for a future adventure \nwhen “fish-men” (kuo-tua? sahuagin?) begin to \nattack the town. \n \n\nο The Goblin Lair: The goblins that escape \nhave a long march home.  PCs could track \nthem back to the old fort that they are now \nusing as a lair, and find the goblins preparing \nfor war.   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nThe Old Mine \n \n\n \n \n(See next page for the map of the ravine).\n\nScaling the Adventure\n \nAlthough intended as an introduction for low-\nlevel characters, there are some adjustments\npossible for more experienced parties: \n \n\nο 3rd-level PCs: Double the number of “Cut”\ngoblins and goblin warriors.  Make Gar-Wog\na 4th-level sorcerer.  \n \n\nο 5th-level PCs: Triple the number of “cut”\ngoblins, add a worg for each of the goblin\nwarriors and the sorcerer, who are resting in\nthe entrance to the mine (or foraging around)\nthe brush. Make Gar-Wog a 4th-level\nsorcerer.  \n \n\nο 7th-level PCs: Quadruple the number of\n“cut” goblins, and triple the number of\nwarriors making them 3rd level; make Gar-\nwog a 6th-level sorcerer, with an assistant of\nthe same level as Gar-wog is in the original\nadventure, add a warrior-leader who is 5th\n\nlevel, add a worg for each of the warriors,\nand one for Gar-wog and his assistant – give\nGar-wog a heavy mace +2, and his leather\narmor masterwork.  \n\n\n\nRITES OF PASSAGE \n \n\n© 2001 MIDGARD On-Line d20 Adventures: http://www.matantisi.com/aquerra/midgard/midgard.htm  6  \n\n \n\n \n \n \nThe broken lines show the graduated level downwards towards the center/bottom of the ravine.

Many caravans stop here \nalong the trading route, therefore the town pros-\npers during the summer and fall trading months.  \nWithout the caravans to help support the town \nFour Winds it would simply be a small hamlet \nwith a few farms. \n\nThe nearby mountains and forest present \nthe local danger to the inhabitants of the town.  \nThere are many bands of kobolds, goblins that \noccasionally try raiding the town.  The local mi-\nlitia of Four Winds is experienced in repelling \nthese attacks. \n\nwww.opengamingworld.com\nhttp://www.opengamingworld.com/\n\n\nThe shrine of Aqual is located outside of \nthe town near the foothills of the mountains \nnearby.  It was built many years ago by an old \npriest named Colebrun.  The shrine is actually \nlocated just above a natural underground river \nthat descends from the mountains.  A man-made \nwell of water is the heart of the shrine.  The wa-\nter well descends down into the underground \nriver where fresh water can be pulled up from \nthe well bucket.  The priest Colebrun estab-\nlished this shrine several decades ago when dry \nweather had caused the death of many town \npeople.  Since this time the shrine has been a \nmost revered and religious place in the hearts of \nthe towns people. \n\nRecently two events have occurred to cause \nthe townsfolk to worry.  A few months ago the \nshrine had become haunted with undead ghosts.  \nA young boy named Mercus was nearly killed \nwhen he was gathering water from the shrines \nwell one day.  He was attacked by an undead \ncreature that came out of the well.  This sent a \npanic through the townsfolk and since this time \nnobody has gone to shrine.  The local militia \nhad investigated the shrine but never found any \nmonsters. \n\nThe second problem to plague the town is \nthat the Sunmore creek is drying up.  This creek \nis the main water source for the town and passes \nthrough its center.  The creeks water flow has \ndemised so much that it is causing the merchant \ncaravans to pass by the town of Four Winds.  \nWithout the water from the creek the caravans \ncannot refresh the thirst of their horses and other \nanimals. \n\nMany of the Towns people believe that \nAqual has forsaken them and is punishing the \ncitizens of Four Winds.  Some people have al-\nready left town in search of work elsewhere in \nthe kingdom.  Many other folk are considering \nleaving the town for good. \n\nUnknown to the people of Four Winds the \nunderground of the shrine was inhabited by a \nsmall tribe of kobolds.  They had made their \nhome within the caverns formed by the natural \nunderground river.  The kobolds had actually \n\nbeen living there for many years undetected un-\ntil just a few months ago. \n\nA group of duergar dwarf warriors de-\nscended from the mountains in search of food \nand stumbled upon the kobold caves.  The duer-\ngar managed to slaughter all the kobolds and \novertake their cave dwellings.  The dark \ndwarves also discovered a large deposit of gold \nwithin the underground river.  Since waylaying \nthe kobolds they have been busily mining the \ngold nuggets found in the stream. \n\nSince this time the duergar have managed \nto dam up a part of the underground river in or-\nder to search for more gold deposits.  A power-\nful duergar cleric also came and went from the \narea.  He cast some raise dead spells in order to \nward off any snooping humans from visiting the \nshrine of Aqual from the town of Four Winds. \n\nAdventure Synopsis \nThe characters must head to the shrine of Aqual \nand investigate the rumors of ghosts.  Once they \narrive they will discover that the shrine is in-\nfested with skeletons and zombie of undead ko-\nbolds.  As they descend into the shrines water \nwell they will find the duergar stronghold.  They \nmust seal off the cavern passage that leads \ndeeper into the underdark and destroy the un-\nderground dam which is diverting water away \nfrom Sunmore creek. \n\nPre-Made Player Characters \nThere are four pre-made player characters at the \nend of this adventure.  These characters can be \nused by the players or customized characters \ncan be used.  The pre-made characters are a \nsmall adventuring group that have been together \na short time.  This will be their first real test to-\ngether. \n\nAdventure Hooks \nThe PCs may come to Four Winds for any num-\nber of reasons. As the DM, it is your job to de-\n\n\n\ncide how best to involve them in the adventure. \nYou can use the following hooks to spur your \nimagination, modifying them as necessary to fit \nyour campaign or the characters. \n \n\n• The PCs live in Four Winds and know \nmany of the Towns people who own \nmerchant stores that are close to going \nout of business. \n\n• The characters can come upon the town \nand here of the plight of its people.  \nThey can talk to the local priest of Aqual \nwho would offer them a small reward for \nsolving the problems at the shrine. \n\n• The PCs may stop at the shrine for water \nand be attacked by the kobold undead.  \nThey could hear about the Towns trou-\nbles and decide to investigate the under-\nground river of the shrine. \n\n \n\nBeginning the Adventure \nUnless the PCs arrived at the shrine by some \nother means, the adventure begins when they ar-\nrive in Four Winds.  The players should hear \nrumors about a haunted shrine which has cursed \nthe small town.  This will be the main adventure \nhook for the PCs.  \n\nFour Winds \nThe town of Four Winds is a small but prosper-\nous town along the northern trading routes of \nZym.  The town depends heavily on the passing \ncaravans and merchants. The nearby region is \nnot the best for farming and Four Winds is situ-\nated strategically along the northern trade \nroutes.  Most caravans stop in Four Winds to re-\nplenish their food and water before continuing \nnorth to the city of Wallfort. \n\nSince the town is situated close to a small \nset of mountains there are occasional problems \nwith raiding goblins and kobolds.  Some nastier \ncreatures inhabit the mountains, but are rarely \never seen. \n\nTwo problems plague Four Winds at pre-\nsent.  The Towns beloved shrine of Aqual has \nbeen overrun with undead creatures and the \nSunmore creek which passes through the town \nhas almost dried up completely.  Because of this \nthe caravans are no longer stopping in Four \nWinds over the last several months and the town \nis slowly dying.  Several families have already \nleft their stores and homes abandoned. \n\n \n\nA. Around the Town \nThe NPCs encountered in the town can explain \nplainly the events of the past few months.  They \ncan direct the characters to the local priest of \nAqual, the mayor or the militia. \n \n\nThe town of Four Winds is a small place and \nsome of the buildings seem deserted.  A few \nchildren play in the streets near a dried up \ncreek bed, but there is little else of interest.  \nThis place has definitely fallen upon hard \ntimes.  \n\nA1. Priest of Aqual \nBragus is the young priest who recently took \nover the duties of caring for the shrine of Aqual. \nHe will be quite pleased to see the PCs arrive at \nhis door. Bragus will offer the characters a small \nreward for clearing out the shrine of all crea-\ntures.  He can offer up to 100 GP.   \n\nBragus knows of the history of the shrine \nand will explain all that he knows, including the \ninjury of the young boy Mercus.  The priest \nknows nothing about the duergar dwarves or the \nkobold undead.  He is totally oblivious as to \nwhat has happened underneath the shrine that he \ncares for. \n\nBecause of a broken leg injury Bragus has \nbeen unable visit the shrine in the last several \nmonths.  His leg has healed recently but he is \nunable to walk very far. \n\n \nBragus: male human priest; hp 4; level 0 priest \nof Aqual \n\n\n\nA2. Militia \nThe local militia can also be questioned.  They \nhave investigated the shrine several times, but \nhaven’t encountered any monsters.  The militia \nare responsible defenders of the town but are \nunable to give the PCs any further information.   \n\nLately the local Militia has been forced by \nthe mayor to transport drinking water by horse \ninto the town.  They investigated the creek \nmouth where the water flows out of the ground.  \nThey noticed that the water flow was very low, \nbut did nothing about it.  They can tell the char-\nacters that creek starts flowing from out of the \nground not far away from the shrines location. \n\n \nTartanian: male human fighter; hp 5, level 0 \nfighter; leader of the Towns militia \n\nA3. Town Mayor \nThe mayor of Four Winds is actually a woman \nnamed Catherine.  She is under a lot of pressure \nfrom the townsfolk lately.  She has a sign hang-\ning outside her door saying “trespassers will be \narrested.”   \n\nIf the characters approach her door for in-\nformation she is a bit abrasive at first, but sof-\ntens up quickly when she realizes the group may \nbe able to help her.  She seems overly concerned \nwith water flow in the Towns creek.  She has \nbeen using the militia daily to bring water in \nfrom a stream an hour away.  She is doing this \nto try and entice the caravans and merchants to \nstop in Four Winds as per normal.  But the mili-\ntia cannot transport enough water to supply all \nthe townsfolk and outsiders that may visit.   \n\nCatherine seems totally unconcerned with \nthe happenings of the shrine and doesn’t know \nany more about it then the priest Bragus.  She \nwill pay the PCs as much as 250GP if they can \nfigure why the creek isn’t flowing properly or \nbetter yet correct the creeks water flow problem. \n \nCatherine: female human; hp3; mayor of Four \nWinds \n\nA4. The Boy who Cried Monster! \nMercus can be found playing in the streets of \nthe town with his friends.  Any child playing on \nthe streets of the town can point out Mercus for \nthe PCs. \n\nThe young boy doesn’t like talking about \nhis confrontation with the undead at the shrine.  \nIf the characters offer him a few coins he will \nopen right up to them.  Mercus is a born liar and \ntends to tell lies mixed with truth to make him-\nself feel more important. \n\nIf given enough coins Mercus will tell the \ncharacters the truth about his undead encounter.  \nThe lie he has told the town people is that he \nsaw ghosts at the shrine and they attacked him.  \nThe truth is that he pulled up the shrines water \nbucket to see a skull head floating in the water.  \nThe skull was from a kobolds head, but Mercus \nis too young to know the difference.  The skele-\nton head actually did try biting the boy and \nMercus will tell the PCs about this event.  If \npressed for more information the young boy \nsimply smiles, shrugs his shoulders and says he \ndoesn’t know. \n\n \nMercus: male human; hp 2; boy attacked by \nundead \n\nA5. Shops \nIn the town the PCs can purchase most equip-\nment and merchandise found in the Players \nHandbook.  Though because there are shortages \nlately, there is a 50% chance that the items they \nare looking for are out of stock. The shops in \nFour Winds are very low on provisions due to \nthe fact that caravans are no longer stopping. \n \n\nB. The Creek and Foothills \nShould the PCs go to investigate the creek \nmouth they will find an underground waterway \nexiting some foothills.  The creek flows out \nfrom underneath the foothills and it is impossi-\nble to enter the caves under the shrine from this \narea.  The amount of water coming from out of \n\n\n\nthe ground is only one quarter of the creeks \nnormal flow.  The water appears normal and \nclear.  The taste of the creeks water is normal. \n\nB1. Creek Mouth \n \n\nThe mouth of the creek seems to come from \nunderground as a small trickle of water bub-\nbles of out the ground opening. \n\n \nThe ground in this area is soft and spongy and \nfull of moss. There is no way to enter the caves \nfrom here. The water flows out of a very small \nand muddy opening in the ground. If the charac-\nters try desperately to enter the underground \nwhere the creek runs out of the hills they will be \nattacked by a small viper snake. The snake \nmakes it home near the mouth of the creek and \nwill only attack if pressed.  There is also an old \npotion of cure light wounds stuck in the mud \nwhere the snake is located.  It must have be-\nlonged to previous victim on the snakes. \n\nViper Snake, Small: hp 4, see Monster \nManual \n\nTreasure: Potion cure light wounds. \n\nB2. Foothills \n \n\nThe rolling foothills lead towards the moun-\ntains off in the distance.  The grass here is \npatchy as the hills are made of moss en-\ncrusted rock.  Occasionally you hear skitter-\ning noises of different wild animals. \n\n \nShould the PCs decide to investigate the foot-\nhills near the creek mouth they will encounter \ntwo dire rats.  The dire rats make their home in \nthe foothills and will attack anything that gets \nclose. \n\nDire Rats (4): hp 5 each, see Monster \nManual \n\n \n\nC. The Shrine of Aqual \nThis place will appear different depending on \nwhen the PCs arrive.  During the day the shrine \nseems peaceful and there are no monsters to be \nfound.  During the night the shrine is haunted by \nseveral undead skeletal kobold.  The skeletons \nrise up from the shrines well every night and \nroam the area.  They never stray too far from the \nshrine but will attack anything within a hundred \nfeet from the shrines edge.  When daylight \ncomes they climb back down the well to avoid \nthe daylight. \n \n\nC1. Shrine \nThe shrine of Aqual rests upon a small hill.  \nThere is a well worn path that leads from the \ntown of Four Winds to the shrine.   \n\n \n\nThe shrine rises up on a hill.  At the top of \nthe hill you can see a ring of stones which \nrepresent the edge of the sacred shrine.  In \nthe center of the stones is a well made of \nwood.  It is ornately built and has several \nsymbols of Aqual carved into it. \n\n \nThe PCs will encounter skeletal kobolds around \nthe shrine only at night.  When daylight arrives \nthe skeletons climb back down the well to the \ncaves below.  These skeletons were animated by \na powerful duergar cleric.  They were a reani-\nmated to protect the well and scare off any curi-\nous snoopers.   \n \n \nNote: Should the players arrive at the shrine \nduring the day the skeletons will not be above-\nground.  Rather, add these skeletons to the num-\nber in the encounter underground in D1. \n \nShould the players arrive at night read this addi-\ntional excerpt. \n \n \n\n\n\nLooking closer by the moonlight you see sev-\neral undead walking around inside the shrine.  \nThey appear to be small standing only about \nthree feet high.  They seem to be attracted the \ncenter of the shrine. \n\n \nSkeletons, Small (8): hp 3 each, see Monster \n\nManual under Skeleton \n \n\nC2. Water Well \nThe water well descends 50 feet down into the \nwater below.  Should the PCs look down the \nwell they won’t be able to see anything.  They \nwill however be able to hear water trickling.  \nThere is no water that can be obtained from the \nwell as it has dried up along with Sunmore \ncreek in the town. \n \n\nThe shrines water well is made of wood and \nhas ornate water symbols of Aqual carved \ninto the base.  There is also a rope with a \nwooden bucket attached to an old pulley sys-\ntem to pull water from the well. \n\n \nTrap: Pit Trap; CR 2; no attack roll neces-\n\nsary (4d6); Reflex save (DC 20) avoids; Search \n(DC 20); Disable Device (DC 20); There is a \ntrap on the pulley system of the water well.  The \nkobolds placed it before they were killed by the \nduergar.  The trap is set to spring should any-\nthing heavier than a bucket of water weigh \ndown the rope attached to the pulley; for in-\nstance should someone were to climb down the \nrope.  If this happens then the pulley will break \nand send the victim plugging into the well.  \n\n \n\nD. Underground River \nThe underground river can only be entered from \nthe shrine of Aqual. The water well from the \nshrine descends 50ft from the surface into the \nunderground.  Unknown to the townsfolk is that \nthe duergar have dammed the underground \n\nriver.  This is the reason that no water is flowing \nin the Sunmore creek and the town of Four \nWinds.  Instead the duergar are mining for gold \njust past the dam in areas D2 and D3 on the un-\nderground river map. The duergar have also re-\nanimated the kobolds to protect the area of D1 \nfrom any land dwelling intruders. \n\nD1. Undead Kobolds \n \n\nThe water well leads into a large dark cave \nwith a small trickle of water flows at its cen-\nter.  There is also a group of small undead \nskeletons and two undead zombies.  Their \nundead eyes glow with hatred and they move \nto attack. \n\n \nThis area is overrun with undead kobolds.  The \nskeletal undead of the kobolds have been reani-\nmated to protect this section of the river.  The \nskeletons will not stop attacking until their foes \nare dead or they have been destroyed.  There is \nalso two more powerful undead kobold zombies \nin this area.  These zombies were once the lead-\ners of the kobold tribe. \n \n\nAs soon as combat begins in area D1 the \nrest of the duergar in the underground will be on \nalert. The duergar will immediately gain the \nsurprise on any further encounters for area D2 \nand D3. \n\n \nSkeletons, Small (8): hp 3 each, see Monster \n\nManual under Skeleton \n \n\nZombies, Small (3): hp 7, see Monster Man-\nual under Zombie \n \n\nTactics: The skeletons are aimless mon-\nsters and they will fight till they are destroyed.  \nThey will do random things that make no tacti-\ncal sense such as expose themselves to attacks \nof opportunities just by moving randomly. \n\n \n\n\n\nD2. Duergar Miners \n \n\nThis area is filled with overturned river stones \nand mud.  There are three large piles of rocks \noff to one side. \n\n \nHere the dark dwarves have been mining for the \nloose gold in the rocks of the underground river.  \nThere is not much gold left here as the duergar \nhave sifted through the riverbed.  Though \nshould the PCs investigate the rocks they will \nfind 5gp worth of gold for every one hour they \nsearch, to a maximum of five hours.  The dark \ndwarves will attempt to ring a large brass bell to \nwarn the others at the first sign of trouble. \n\nHandling the Duergar \nThe PCs have several options in trying to deal \nwith the duergar dwarves.  Should the PCs de-\ncide to attack the duergar head on they will pro-\nbably be all killed in encounter D3.  Once the \nduergar have felt the PCs presence they will be \nready for any further attacks. Should the PCs try \nattacking as best they can one day and then rest-\ning the night in town, when they go back the \nnext day they will discover that the duergar will \nhave restocked their numbers. As DM you \nshould restock the duergar encounter areas with \nthe same numbers should the PCs rest in town \novernight. Therefore they will have to come up \nwith intelligent ways to be victorious. \n \n• Get help from Four Winds. The PCs can \n\ngo back to town and ask for help by explain-\ning about the duergar.  Should they do this \nCaptain Tartanian will send three of his men \nto help the PCs, the rest are busy getting wa-\nter for the towns people.  The militia are all \n1st level fighters with limited fighting skills, \nbut they will each be armed with a scimitar \nand a light crossbow. \n\n \n• Using Fire. The dam located in area D3 is \n\nthe main obstacle for the PCs to overcome.  \nIn town the PCs will be able to purchase \n\nseveral barrels of oil to burn it down. How \nthe players get the oil to the edge of the dam \nis up to you as the DM to decide on.  The oil \nkegs will have a 50% chance of exploding if \nthey are sealed and flame touches them.  \nFire will not smoke-out the duergar as the \ncavern system is too large. \n\n \nDuergar Fighters (3): hp 7, 5, 4; CR 1; Me-\n\ndium humanoid; HD 1d8+1; Init +2; Spd 15 ft.; \nAC 12, touch 12, flat-footed 10; Base \nAtk +1; Atk +2 melee (1d6+3/18–20, master-\nwork handaxe) or +2 ranged (1d8/19–20, mas-\nterwork light crossbow); AL LE; SV Fort +3, \nRef +2, Will +1; Str 15, Dex 14, Con 13, Int 10, \nWis 12, Cha 8. Special: +4 to move silently; \nimmune to paralysis, phantasms, magical and \nalchemical poisons (but not normal poisons); \nspell-like abilities 1/day – enlarge and invisibil-\nity as 3rd level wizard; darkvision 120ft; light \nsensitivity -2 to Atk, Saves, Chks in bright \nsunlight or daylight spell; Listen +1; Spot +1; \nAlertness feat. \n \n\nTactics: If they hear the sounds of melee \ncombat in area D1 than the duergar will be \nready for the PCs.  If they are forced into melee \ncombat they will fight to the death. The duergar \nwill gain surprise on any combat and will be \nhuddled behind piles of stones and will attack \nwith their crossbows. The dark dwarves will be \nhalf concealed behind the rocks and the PCs will \nhave a 50% of missing on any missile attack. \n\nD3. The Dam Wall \n  \n\nA large wooden dam rises up 15 feet from \nthe cavern floor.  Along the top of the dam \nare several barriers.  There is only a trickle of \nwater seeping through the dam, but you can \nhear heavy sounds of rushing water on the \nother side. \n\n \nBy this time the duergar will be ready for the \nPCs after hearing the sounds of combat from \narea D1 and D2.  Sound the players manage to \n\n\n\navoid any melee combat in those areas then they \ncan sneak up on the duergar defending the dam.  \nAlong the top of the dam there are two duergar \nsentries guarding the area from enemy ad-\nvancement. These two duergar will immediately \nbe joined by four more duergar fighters from \narea D4 after the first round of combat.  The \ndam allows up to four duergar to defend it at \nany one time. When a duergar falls another will \ntake it place immediately, until they are all \nkilled. \n \nDestroying the Dam  \nDoing this isn’t easy as the duergar construction \nis solid.  The PCs can attack the dam from the \nground to destroy it, but they may be swept \naway with the water that drains away from the \ndam.  It is not possible to destroy the dam by \nmelee from the top of it.  Burning the wood on \nthe dam is only possible with the help of oil.  \nLighting the dam on fire with the aid of oil will \ncause it to fall apart in 2d6+4 minutes.   \nDam: hp 125 \nShould the dam be destroyed the PCs will still \nbe able to walk through the underground river to \nget to the rest of the areas in the underground.  \nThe water will be up their waist but it will be \npassable. \n \nOnce the players defeat the duergar along the \ntop of the dam wall they will need to climb up \nin order to get on top.  The climbing DC is an \n11 to reach the top. \n \n\nDuergar Sentries (2): hp 8, 6; CR 1; Me-\ndium humanoid; HD 1d8+1; Init +3; Spd 15 ft.; \nAC 12, touch 12, flat-footed 10; Base \nAtk +1; Atk +2 melee (1d6+3/18–20, master-\nwork handaxe) or +3 ranged (1d8/19–20, mas-\nterwork light crossbow); AL LE; SV Fort +3, \nRef +2, Will +1; Str 15, Dex 16, Con 13, Int 10, \nWis 12, Cha 8. Special: +4 to move silently; \nimmune to paralysis, phantasms, magical and \nalchemical poisons (but not normal poisons); \nspell-like abilities 1/day – enlarge and invisibil-\nity as 3rd level wizard; darkvision 120ft; light \n\nsensitivity -2 to Atk, Saves, Chks in bright \nsunlight or daylight spell; Listen +1; Spot +1; \nAlertness feat. \n \n \n\nDuergar Fighters (4): hp 6, 5, 4; CR 1; Me-\ndium humanoid; HD 1d8+1; Init +2; Spd 15 ft.; \nAC 12, touch 12, flat-footed 10; Base \nAtk +1; Atk +2 melee (1d6+3/18–20, master-\nwork handaxe) or +2 ranged (1d8/19–20, mas-\nterwork light crossbow); AL LE; SV Fort +3, \nRef +2, Will +1; Str 15, Dex 14, Con 13, Int 10, \nWis 12, Cha 8. Special: +4 to move silently; \nimmune to paralysis, phantasms, magical and \nalchemical poisons (but not normal poisons); \nspell-like abilities 1/day – enlarge and invisibil-\nity as 3rd level wizard; darkvision 120ft; light \nsensitivity -2 to Atk, Saves, Chks in bright \nsunlight or daylight spell; Listen +1; Spot +1; \nAlertness feat. \n \n\nTactics: The duergar sentries will attack \nwith their light crossbows and have a +1 to all \nattack rolls while firing missile weapons from \nthe top of the dam wall. The duergar also have a \nconcealment advantage and the PCs will have a \n40% chance of missing to hit them while they \nare hiding on top of the wall.  Should the duer-\ngar be in trouble of being defeated one of them \nwill spend a partial action to ring a bell to warn \nthe remaining duergar in area D6. \n\nD4. Duergar Quarters \n \n\nThis room is filled with leather beds and \ntwo crude stonework tables.  A large pile of \nwaste is located in one corner of the room.  \nThere is also a small metal chest beside one \nof the leather beds. \n\n \nIf the PCs managed to knock out the two duer-\ngar sentries in area D3 without making a sound \nthan there will be three duergar fighters waiting \nhere.  Use the duergar fighters stats from the end \nof area D3 if this happens.  Most likely this \nroom will be empty of dark dwarves.   \n\n\n\n \nThere is however a nasty badger that has \n\nbeen trained to attack anything that is not a \nduergar.  The badger is like a pet dog to the \nduergar who we’re working here.  \n \n\nDire Badger (1): hp 18, see Monster Manual \n \n\nTrap: In the room there is a metal chest \nthat contains two potions (potion of cure light \nwounds and potion of heroism) and several gold \nnuggets.  The duergar that owned this chest \ntrapped it with a acid that shoots out from the \nlock.  The acid does 3d6 damage and it is a DC \n12 to disable the locks trap.  The DC is 10 to \npick the lock. \n\nD5. Kobold Quarters \n \n\nThis cave contains the remains of a kobold \nliving area. There are several dead kobold \ncorpses in the center of the room.  Ringing \naround the edge of the room there are several \nold straw beds just the right size for a small \nkobold body.  The room is damp and a small \npool of water forms the center of the room. \n\n \nThis was the main living area for the kobolds \nthat once called these underground caves their \nhome.  Searching room reveals one rusty old \nshort sword and two broken daggers.  Unknown \nto the duergar the kobolds had hidden away a \nstash of gold nuggets behind a secret door in \nthis room.  The door is very small and is only \nlarge enough for a small humanoid to enter, but \nthe PCs can open it and pull out the gold hidden \naway inside it.  The secret door was trapped by \nthe kobolds to protect it. The gold nuggets in the \nsecret door total 425 GP. \n \nTrap: Crushing Hand Trap; CR2; no attack roll \nrequired (1d6); Search (DC 18); Disable Device \n(DC 20); This trap on the secret door will pin \nthe hand of anyone pushing open it.  The trap \nwill also cause a loud whistling sound to emit \nfrom crack in the door.  This trap was meant to \n\npin any hand trying to open the door.  The trap \nonly causes damage if the PC tries to pull their \nhand out of the trap.  To free the hand from the \ntrap the PC must roll a reflex save to avoid the \ndamage. \n\nD6. Duergar Leader \n \n\nYou approach a small underground cave as \nthe passage narrows.  This room has a dimly \nlit candle on a table that radiates light.  You \ncan also hear a loud snoring sound from \nsome humanoid.  The cave roof here seems \nrather unstable. \n\n \nThis area is the headquarters of the duergar ac-\ntivity in this underground river system. This \nroom was freshly dug out not long ago and leads \nfurther into the duergar underdark. This room is \nwhere the duergar leader has been organizing \nthe mining of the river. Unfortunately for the \nduergar leader he has been fast asleep during the \nentire arrival of the PCs. The duergar leader is \nlaying on a leather bed and several empty bottle \nof duergar ale rests at his side. When the PCs \nenter the room they will hear him snoring. As \nsoon as any of the characters speak or if the \nduergar is attacked he will awake immediately. \n \nThe roof of the cave roof is unstable here and \ncould easily crumble with several precise hits.  \nDestroying this cave will permanently block the \nduergar from reaching the gold in the under-\nground river. \n \n\nDkril’Umiq, Duergar Captain: Male duergar \nfighter 3; CR 3; Medium humanoid; HD 3d8; hp \n15; Init +2; Spd 15 ft.; AC 12, touch 12, flat-\nfooted 10; Base Atk +1; Grp +2; Atk +3 melee \n(2d4+1/18–20, masterwork falchion) or +4 \nranged (1d8/[TS]3, masterwork composite \nlongbow); Full Atk +3 melee (2d4+1/18–20, \nmasterwork falchion) or +4 ranged (1d8/[TS]3, \nmasterwork composite longbow); SQ favored \nenemy (humans +2), wild empathy +2; AL LE; \nSV Fort +3, Ref +5, Will +3; Str 12, Dex 15, \n\n\n\nCon 10, Int 14, Wis 10, Cha 13.

If the players didn’t destroy the passage \nthat leads further into the underdark then they \ncould journey further into the duergar domain.  \nThis could lead to more adventures in the un-\nderground and the PCs could discover the \nwhereabouts of the powerful duergar cleric.  \nThe players could also search out to find the \nwhereabouts of more kobolds in the hills.  The \nkobolds could be planning an attack on the out-\nskirts of the town in order to replenish their \ndwindling food supplies.  The players may dis-\ncover that the kobolds and duergar have been at \nwar with each other in the mountains north of \nFour Winds for quite some time.

His mother raised him in a small town called Riverglen in \nthe south of Zym. Veric spent his boyhood days delving into the \nmountain caves near his home. In one of his cave adventures \nhe uncovered a small treasure chest that contained gold and a \nmap. Taking the gold he decided to outfit himself as an adven-\nturer. Veric left his home and hired out his sword to work as \nmercenary on several caravans.  It was here that he met his \nfemale friend Evirial. Veric has a crush on Evirial, but is afraid \nto say anything to her about his feelings. He is attracted to her \nhalf-elven beauty but doesn’t really want to ruin their good \nfriendship. Her skill as a thief complements his fighting skills. \nTogether Evirial and Veric travel in search of work as adventur-\ners. Veric keeps his treasure map secret, but is always looking \nfor the location of the unknown cave. Veric is trying to form a \nsmall adventuring group starting with Evirial and himself. Re-\ncently they have been traveling with Jehsop the cleric for sev-\neral weeks having met up with him back in Wallfort. Veric just \nrecently invited the elven wizard Saelthir to join their adventur-\ning group.  Though, he isn’t sure about the wizard as he senses \ntension between Saelthir and Evirial.  \n\n\n\nEvirial (Half-Elf Female, Rogue 2, C.Neutral) \nAbility Scores\nStrength 12 ( + 1) Size: Medium \nDexterity 16 ( + 3) Height: 5' 3\" \nConstitution 11 ( + 0) Weight: 95 lb \nIntelligence 11 ( + 0) Eyes: Green \nWisdom 9 (-1) Hair: Light Brown \nCharisma 16 ( + 3) \n\n \n\nSkin: Light \n \nTotal Hit Points: 10 \nSpeed: 30 feet  \nAC: 15 = 10 + 2 [leather] + 3 [dexterity]  \n\nTouch AC: 13 \nFlat-footed: 12 \n \n\nSavings Throws \nFortitude save: + 0 = 0 [base]  \nReflex save: + 6 = 3 [base] + 3 [dexterity]  \nWill save: -1 = 0 [base] -1 [wisdom]  \nInitiative modifier: + 7 = + 3 [dexterity] + 4 [improved initiative] \nFear check: -1 = -1 [wisdom]  \nHorror check: -1 = -1 [wisdom]  \nMadness check: -1 = -1 [wisdom]  \nAttack (handheld): + 2 = 1 [base] + 1 [strength]  \nAttack (missile): + 4 = 1 [base] + 3 [dexterity]  \nGrapple check: + 2 = 1 [base] + 1 [strength]  \n \nLanguages: Common, Elven \nFeats: Improved Initiative \n \nWeapons & Armor \n• Dagger [1d4, crit 19-20/x2, range inc 10 ft., 1 lb., light, \n\npiercing]  \n• Dart [1d4, crit x2, range inc. 20 ft., 1/2 lb, piercing]  \n• Sap [1d6 nonlethal, crit x2., 2 lb., light, bludgeoning]  \n• Short Sword [1d6, crit 1-20/x2, 1 lb, light, piercing]  \n• Shortbow [1d6, crit x3, range inc. 60 ft., 2 lb., piercing]  \n• Leather armor [light; + 2 AC; max dex + 6; check pen-\n\nalty 0; 15 lb.] \n \nSkills\n\nSkill Name Key Ability \nSkill \nModifier \n\nAbil-\nity \nModif\nier \n\nRank\ns \n\nMisc. \nModifier \n\nAppraise Int 4 =  + 0 + 4  \nBalance Dex* 6 =  + 3 + 3  \nBluff Cha 6 =  + 3 + 3  \nClimb Str* 5 =  + 1 + 4  \nConcentration Con 0 =  + 0   \nDiplomacy Cha 5 =  + 3  + 2 [half-elf]  \nDisable Device Int 4 =  + 0 + 4  \nDisguise Cha 4 =  + 3 + 1  \nEscape Artist Dex* 3 =  + 3   \nForgery Int 1 =  + 0 + 1  \nGather Information Cha 6 =  + 3 + 1 + 2 [half-elf]  \nHeal Wis -1 =  -1   \nHide Dex* 4 =  + 3 + 1  \nIntimidate Cha 3 =  + 3   \nJump Str* 1 =  + 1   \n\nListen Wis 0 =  -1  + 1 [half-elf]  \nMove Silently Dex* 8 =  + 3 + 5  \nOpen Lock Dex 7 =  + 3 + 4  \nRide Dex 3 =  + 3   \nSearch Int 5 =  + 0 + 4 + 1 [half-elf]  \nSense Motive Wis -1 =  -1   \nSpot Wis 0 =  -1  + 1 [half-elf]  \nSurvival Wis -1 =  -1   \nSwim Str** 2 =  + 1 + 1  \nTumble Dex* 6 =  + 3 + 3  \nUse Rope Dex 4 =  + 3 + 1  \n* = check penalty for wearing armor  \n \nHalf-Elf Special Abilities \nImmune to magical sleep; + 2 racial bonus on saves vs. enchant-\n\nments; Low-light vision; + 1 racial bonus on listen, search, \nand spot checks; + 2 racial bonus on diplomacy and gather \ninformation checks \n\nRogue Special Abilities \nSneak Attack +1d6; Trapfinding; Evasion (level 2) \n \nEquipment\n22 lb\n6 lb \n2 lb \n5 lb \n2 lb \nn/a \nn/a \nn/a \nn/a \nn/a \nn/a \nn/a \n1lb \n\nWeapons / Armor / Shield\n(from above) \nArrows (quiver of 20) x2 \nBackpack \nBedroll \nCaltrops \nCandle \nChalk \nFishhook \nFlint and steel \nInk vial \nInk pen \nLamp (common) \n\n 1 lb  \n1 lb \n2 lb \n1 lb \n3 lb \n5 lb \n5 lb \n1 lb \n1 lb \n4 lb \n1 lb \n_____ \n63 lb \n\nLocks x1 \nManacles x1 \nMirror \nPitons x5 \nRations (1 day) x5 \nRope (50', silk) x1 \nSacks x1 \nSpyglass \nWaterskins x1 \nWhetstone \nThieves' tools \n \nTotal \n\n \nDescription: Evirial is a half-elf from the city of Skykeep. She \ngrew up on the streets of the city, escaping her abusive father \nat the age of nine.  She nearly died on the streets until she \njoined the Thieves Guild and was apprenticed by an older boy \nnamed Marl.  After several years of thievery she was caught \nby the city guards and thrown into the dungeons of Skykeep \nfor three years.  During her imprisonment she was abused and \nviolated by an evil guard.  When she was finally released from \nprison she hunted down the abusive guard and killed him in his \nsleep. Evirial escaped Skykeep and has vowed to never go \nback again.  She began working as a mercenary for hire.  She \nwas hired to make sure thieves did not steal from the caravans \nshe worked.  On one such caravan journey she met Veric a \nhuman male fighter.  She likes Veric, but her history with abu-\nsive men does not let her get close to anyone.  She has ad-\nventured with Veric for several months now and thinks he is \nkeeping a secret from her. Evirial is following Veric’s idea of \nforming a adventurers group, but isn’t sure she trusts Jehsop \nthe new Cleric.  Jehsop seems to talk to himself a lot and \nEvirial is very unnerved by it.  She thinks Jehsop is a little \ncrazy to say the least. \n\n\n\nJehsop (Human Male, Cleric 2, Neutral Good) \nAbility Scores \nStrength 16 ( + 3) Size: Medium \nDexterity 13 ( + 1) Height: 5' 9\" \nConstitution 11 ( + 0) Weight: 220 lb \nIntelligence 11 ( + 0) Eyes: Dark Brown \nWisdom 17 ( + 3) Hair: Dark Brown \nCharisma 9 (-1) \n\n \n\nSkin: Tan \n \nTotal Hit Points: 15  \nSpeed: 30 feet  \nAC: 16 = 10 + 4 [chain shirt] + 1 [light steel] + 1 [dexterity]  \n\nTouch AC: 11 \nFlat-footed: 15 \n\nDeity: Aqual, elemental god of water \nDomains: Healing, Water, Protection  \n\n \nSaving Throws \nInitiative modifier: + 1 = + 1 [dexterity]  \nFear check: + 3 = + 3 [wisdom]  \nHorror check: + 3 = + 3 [wisdom]  \nMadness check: + 3 = + 3 [wisdom]  \nFortitude save: + 3 = 3 [base]  \nReflex save: + 1 = 0 [base] + 1 [dexterity]  \nWill save: + 6 = 3 [base] + 3 [wisdom]  \nAttack (handheld): + 4 = 1 [base] + 3 [strength]  \nAttack (missile): + 2 = 1 [base] + 1 [dexterity]  \nGrapple check: + 4 = 1 [base] + 3 [strength]  \n \nLanguages: Common \nFeats: Improved Turning, Skill Focus (Heal) \n \nWeapons & Armor \n• Dagger [1d4, crit 19-20/x2, range inc 10 ft., 1 lb., light, \n\npiercing]  \n• Heavy Mace [1d8, crit x2, 8 lb., one-handed, bludg-\n\neoning]  \n• Sling [1d4, crit x2, range inc. 50 ft., 0 lb, bludgeoning]  \n• Chain shirt [light; + 4 AC; max dex + 4; check penalty \n\n-2; 25 lb.]  \n• Light Steel Shield [ + 1 AC; check penalty -1; hard-\n\nness 10; hp 10; 6 lb.] \n \nSkills\n\nSkill Name Key Ability \n\nSkill \nModi-\nfier \n\nAbil-\nity \nModi-\nfier \n\nRanks Misc.

He was born in the seaport town of Wayfleet and \nhas always had an affinity to the sea.  Jehsop was born to a \nwealthy merchant and his father sent him away to be educated in \nthe religion of Aqual.  During his second year of training on the \nWinter Isles Jehsop’s convent was sacked by pirates. Several of \nhis best friends were killed during the attack. Soon after Jehsop \nbegan training as a combat priest with the purpose avenging his \ndead friends. He realized this was wrong, but continued his com-\nbat training. After becoming a full priest he left to search out his \npurpose in Aqual’s eyes. He soon found himself traveling from \nplace to place aiding his deity’s followers.

He grew up in the wilds of the great forest.  He \nwas raised by his father, a great wizard of much renown.  \nHis father taught him about the duality of magic, and how \nits power can corrupt people to do evil.  Sealthir had long \nwished to journey into the world of Zymlandia and when he \ncame of age he left his homeland in search of adventure.  \nHe traveled first to the city of Wallfort and accidentally got \nembroiled in plot to kill a rich merchant.  His naiveté was \ntaken advantage of by some unscrupulous thieves.  He \nwas made to believe that the merchant had abducted sev-\neral infants to sell as slaves.  He didn’t find out till it was \ntoo late that the thieves had planned revenge for the mer-\nchant not paying their extortion fees.  The merchant was \nkilled right before Saelthir eyes and with his own dagger.  \nHe escaped Wallfort before the thieves could kill him, but \nknows that they are still hunting him.  He was also blamed \nfor the merchant death.  Saelthir is now cautious of any \nthieves and now doesn’t trust anyone in that profession.  \nHe ran into the other party members along the road a few \nnights ago.  He shared a fire with them and Veric asked \nSaelthir to join them along the road south.  He is cautious \nof the other group members, but willing to adventure with \nthem.  Though, he doesn’t trust Evirial the thief. \n\n\n\tCredits\n\tPreparation\n\tAdventure Background\n\tAdventure Synopsis\n\tPre-Made Player Characters\n\tAdventure Hooks\n\tBeginning the Adventure\n\tFour Winds\n\n\tA.

In the Epilogue to the FIEND FOLIOª Tome I said that TSR Hobbies (UK) Limited had plans, and this module represents the first fruit of those plans. We sincerely hope you like it and the others that will follow.\n\nThere is, I suppose inevitably, one drawback. Though at TSR UK we know how popular the AD&D game has become and have a pretty good idea of how much more popular it will become in the next year or so, the fact remains that the majority of readers of this module, and 'our' others to follow, will not be UK citizens; most will be Americans and there will be others who live elsewhere, in non-English-speaking countries or otherwise. Which raises the problem of varying usage of English language. It came as something of a surprise to me to discover that the English language - theoretically the same in both countries - enjoys far wider deviations in usage than I had realised between the UK and the USA. The differences are not solely products of differing slang and jargon; there are much more subtle differences in emphasis, in the recognition of what is 'correct' use of the language, in the nuance of the meanings of certain words.\n\nNow this module is written in the English that I use and may therefore appear slightly different in flavour from the language to which the majority of its readers will be accustomed. In one sense I make no apologies for this; it is an English module and it would be less than representative if it did not carry something of that atmosphere. In another sense, I am aware that some readers might therefore find the reading slightly unfamiliar, and if this in any way detracts from their enjoyment of the module, then my apologies are due.\n\nSo, American readers - if you find the text too flowery and florid or too plain and stilted, the structure of the language slightly unusual, the use of certain words apparently slightly off-beat, these are the reasons. Perhaps you will take solace in knowing that UK readers of all the other TSRª modules have the same reaction in reverse! I sincerely hope you enjoy it.\n\nDon Turnbull\nManaging Director, TSR Hobbies (UK) Limited\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nTHE SINISTER SECRET OF SALTMARSH is the first module in a three-part series. It is itself divided into two separate adventures, THE HAUNTED HOUSE and SEA GHOST, each of which is, in likely playing time, relatively short. The series is primarily designed to be played as a series - characters start with little or no experience and work successively through the three parts, accumulating experience as they succeed in each endeavour. By the time they embark on the adventure in U2, DANGER AT DUNWATER, those characters who began U1 as fledgling adventurers should have accumulated enough experience points to advance to second level. Similarly, those same characters should be well established at the second experience level if they cope with U2 and pursue their adventures to their logical conclusion in U3, THE FINAL ENEMY. Indeed, if really good fortune smiles on them, they may leave Saltmarsh at the start of U3 as third level characters.\n\nThis module is designed for 5-10 characters of experience levels 1-3. Particularly if the series is to be played in its entirety, it will be important for characters to gain higher experience levels before they tackle the dangers of U3 (otherwise it will be too tough for them!). The Dungeon Master should take careful note of the section in the Dungeon Masters Guide (page 86) regarding 'Gaining Experience Levels,' particularly the time to be spent in training. The Dungeon Master should feel free to waive or modify some of these training requirements to avoid unrealistically long inter-adventure training periods.\n\nThe series is therefore ideal for the experienced AD&D player who wishes to develop a low-level character as well as for the novice player who is experiencing AD&D adventure gaming for the first time. It is perfectly feasible for this module, and indeed for only THE HAUNTED HOUSE scenario, to be played as a single adventure. Though progression to U2 and hence to U3 would be logical, it is not vital -- this adventure can satisfactorily finish at the end of U1 (or even at the end of THE HAUNTED HOUSE if players then prefer their characters to explore elsewhere). However, to play SEA GHOST requires either previous experience in THE HAUNTED HOUSE or an explanatory preface by the Dungeon Master to acquaint players with necessary elements of what they would have experienced. Similarly, U2 and U3 cannot really be played satisfactorily without experience from or an explanation of the earlier part(s) of the series. U2 and U3 include a summary of previous 'events' to aid the Dungeon Master in this respect.\n\nAt this point those readers who wish to play in this adventure should stop reading. The subsequent paragraphs are for the information of the Dungeon Master ONLY! For the information of the Dungeon Master (only) a summary of the plot of this module is given in the Appendix\n\nTHE TOWN OF SALTMARSH\n\nThe little town of Saltmarsh plays a pivotal role in all four adventures -- the two presented here and those presented in U2 and U3. The 'secret' of Saltmarsh derives from the nature of the town and its surroundings. The Town Council of Saltmarsh will encourage the party to undertake the various adventures (and, to a limited extent, support it financially). It is to Saltmarsh that the party will repair between adventures; it is within the town, and with its people, that the characters will spend several weeks or even months of their adventuring careers. Furthermore, there is a web of intrigue in the town, woven long before the adventures begin, which will only become apparent to the players as the series develops. Indeed, if the players are particularly obtuse, they may not be aware of this at all, until too late...\n\nTherefore, if there is to be an adequate background to the series, the DM is recommended to 'prepare' the town quite thoroughly, using the guidelines presented in this module as the basis for that preparation. The DM's own style and preferences will govern just how much preparation is done and in how much detail, but it is suggested that attention be given to at least some of the following:\n\n1.\tThe Town Council. Name the members; determine their trades/occupations and something of their backgrounds; decide how powerful and wealthy each member is, relative to the local community.\n\n2.\tTreat other prominent local citizens who are not members of the Council in a way similar to Council members (in particular the merchant-receiver whose part in the plot is explained in the description of room 15).\n\n3.\tDraw a map of the town, locating prominent buildings and the places where Council members and other important people carry on their business.\n\n4.\tDecide where the characters could stay when resting in the town between adventures (the best inn? the only inn?); draw up a tariff (list of expenditures) for their accommodation and food.\n\n5.\tDecide where to locate the town's place(s) of worship and which deity is worshipped there. The AD&D hardback books, particularly the relevant sections of the Dungeon Masters Guide, should prove helpful in these tasks. Don't skimp them, for in this series of modules the events that take place between adventures are nearly as important as the adventures themselves. Your players' characters will spend a lot of time in Saltmarsh, so do it - and them - justice!\n\nThe Town is a small, respectable fishing town. The inhabitants are relatively sober, hard working and amiable. There are adequate facilities for justice and law-enforcement -- debtors and bankrupts are dealt with particularly harshly. Fishing is the main industry but there are some tiny farms in the neighbouring countryside. The town boasts a small weekly market to which traders are attracted from two larger towns, Burle and Seaton, each some twenty miles away (Burle inland to the northwest, Seaton along the coast to the east). In general, be guided by any small south-coast English fishing town of the 14th Century and with population about 2,000. On the WORLD OF GREYHAWKª map, Saltmarsh is placed in the southernmost part of Keoland, at the western edge of hex U4/123.\n\nTHE LEGEND\n\nFour miles east of Saltmarsh, just inland of the old coast road and looking out to sea, stands the Haunted House. Until twenty years ago it had been the residence of an aged alchemist/magician of sinister reputation, and even then had been shunned by reason of its owner's mysterious occupations. Now, two decades after the sudden and unexplained disappearance of its occupant, the house has acquired an even greater air of evil and mystery with the passing years.\n\nDilapidated and now long-abandoned, the house presents an unwholesome appearance to the eye. Those hardy souls who have on infrequent occasion sought entry to it (for rumours of a secret hoard of alchemical gold have persisted since the old man's disappearance) have all returned with naught save grim tales of decay presided over by monstrous perils. In more recent years there have been reports of fearsome hauntings - ghastly shrieks and eerie lights emanating from within the dismal place. Now not even the bravest dare so much as to approach the house, leave alone enter it. Indeed, such is the reputation of the house that the fields around it, though prime agricultural land, remain untended and rank with weeds.\n\nShould the adventurers, after learning about the house, seek anyone in the town who has been in the place, they will initially find no one. Persistent questioning of the town's inhabitants will tend to make them frightened and apprehensive, but will not yield any concrete information. If the party pursue their questioning, characters may (DM's discretion) find an aged poacher who will, after suitable inducement (money and/or ale), confess to having wandered into the back door of the house a couple of years before, hoping to 'acquire' some food. Diverted by the prospect of free wine in the cellar, he started to descend the stairs, heard ghastly shrieks and piercing wails - and ran, frightened out of his wits. He knows where the back door is and will have noticed the well. He will be able to describe, roughly, the kitchen and scullery and the passage that leads to them from the back door, but he knows nothing else of the layout of the place. Furthermore, his memory of what frightened him has become elaborated over the years, so he is as likely as not to tell the party of a horde of ghosts coming up the stairs to the scullery or a vampire with many rats. He discovered soon after his escapade that the telling of his tale, in lurid and exaggerated detail, was a simple means of obtaining free ale, plied upon him by eager listeners, but there have been none recently who have asked him to tell and, once his tongue is loosened, he will be eager to restore some lost prestige. Apart from alerting adventurers to sinister and grave dangers (which don't in fact exist) and telling them a little about the layout of the house, he will provide no useful information.\n\nGENERAL NOTES\n\nThe secret of the Haunted House is that the house is not in fact haunted but is the shore base for a band of smugglers whose leader is an Illusionist of the fourth experience level.  The eerie lights seen at night by residents of Saltmarsh are the smugglers' signals to a ship out at sea. The unearthly shrieks and other sounds are caused by magic mouth spells appropriately placed within the building. This is why, in recent times, the House's reputation for evil has increased; the smugglers, in about three years of successful operations, have by these means completely frightened away all local investigation, official and unofficial. It is paramount that the players are given no obvious clues that would lead them to believe the house is not haunted; they must deduce the truth for themselves or simply stumble upon it. They might even wander around the house, finding a little treasure but never discovering what actually takes place there.\n\nThis module and the other two in the series are designed for thinking players. Those who tackle the adventures imaginatively and thoughtfully will not only obtain good rewards for their characters but will derive the satisfaction of seeing the various layers of the plot peel away as the real meaning of each clue is discovered. On the other hand, those who regard the House as nothing but monster-slaying territory will not only fail to unravel the secrets but will find their adventure dull and unsatisfactory; they may even lose their characters, for the smugglers, in the hands of a competent DM, should be more than a match for an unwary, careless party.\n\nThe Dungeon Master should also be careful, for similar reasons. If the adventures are prepared casually and laconically, the party could easily become impatient or bored. The DM should prepare the ground thoroughly and 'supervise' the play inventively, sustaining some tension in the atmosphere without giving away any secrets. In particular, the assassin (see part 1, room 15) should be handled very carefully; premature discovery of his real nature as a result of lack of caution on the DM's part might make the entire smuggling operation transparent to the party, and hence vulnerable.\n\nIt is recommended that the DM read both parts of the module thoroughly before play starts, making notes in the margin and/or the Dungeon Masters Adventure Log (available as a TSR publication) where an aide memoir would be useful. Even if only THE HAUNTED HOUSE is to be played immediately, read SEA GHOST too, for this will give an important perspective.\n\nIt will be noticed that encounter descriptions are divided into 'boxed' and 'open' sections. The information in the 'boxed' sections should be read to the players together with approximate dimensions of the area (these can be given more accurately if the party is willing to take time in measurement). Even if not specifically mentioned in the 'boxed' text, describe other features of the area (steps, pillars, etc.) that would be seen without difficulty. Initially the party can act only on this information -- hints are sometimes provided in this text, and the DM should only provide vague supporting information if requested. The remaining 'open' sections and all the introductory paragraphs are for the DM alone and should not be conveyed to the players until they discover the facts for themselves. Where monsters are mentioned in the text, abbreviated statistics are included for quick reference. For full details, consult the Monster Manual or the Fiend Folioª tome as appropriate. Don't forget the house has the reputation of being haunted, and the people of Saltmarsh have good reason for this belief. Until the adventurers find the smugglers, try to make their experience an eerie one, using the room descriptions as the bare bones on which to work. Try to scare them! \n\nIn both adventures, there will be activity at the location of the adventure when the party arrives. Neither the smugglers nor the crew should simply be left at their original starting locations until discovered by party members, unless of course the party is fortunate enough to take unawares and in turn each small group before significant activity has taken place. Even then it should be remembered that the smugglers and crew are in 'motion'; for instance, surprising the group of smugglers in cavern area 27 will soon be common knowledge to the other smugglers as they bring contraband up from the lower caves. The DM must use imagination and discretion to have them react in a manner fitting the prevailing circumstances and not regard them simply as fixtures in their separate areas. The DM should also note that the smugglers are quite intelligent, well organised and conversant with the House, caverns and surroundings, except for secret area 24 of which they know nothing. Consequently, if they should become aware of the party's intrusion they will react in a co-operative and efficient manner to locate and destroy the intruders.\n\nIn a similar vein, even after the adventurers have discovered the smugglers, they should be given no clues other than those they find for themselves, either about the nature of the seagoing side of the smugglers’ organisation or about the weapon-running aspect of the Sea Ghost's operation. Thus, have the smugglers and crew go about their normal business until such time as they realise their activities have been discovered; then have them react in co-ordinated fashion to deal with the menace and to preserve their illicit secret. Sanbalet, the smuggler chief, is intelligent and shrewd enough to have prepared an emergency plan in the event of discovery and to train his men in carrying it out; the DM would be well advised to follow his example. Should the party elect to leave the House before completing the adventure and then seek to return at a later time, there are two possibilities and it is for the DM to decide which should apply. Obviously, the smugglers will realise fairly soon that there have been intruders in the House. If they have no reason to suspect their activities have been discovered, they will continue about their business, perhaps posting extra guards for a short time. Alternatively, if they have good reason to believe their activities have been discovered, they will flee the locale, taking all their contraband and possessions with them, so that on return the party will find no trace of them. It is unlikely that the same will apply to the Sea Ghost. Once a party has bearded the ship, it is almost inconceivable that they will leave without discovering something. In this extremely unlikely event the DM will have to decide how to deal with such an obviously dense, unadventurous party of characters!\n\nPART ONE - THE HAUNTED HOUSE\n\n... Wherein the party discovers the first part of THE SINISTER SECRET OF SALTMARSH.\n\nPREAMBLE\n\nIt is suggested that the Dungeon Master should introduce the players to the adventure in the following way:\n\n1.\tHave the party meet at Saltmarsh as a result of vague rumours that there is worthy work for adventurers in the neighbourhood.\n\n2.\tDescribe the town - provide the players with maps and other information you have prepared, such as they could reasonably be expected to observe for themselves on arriving.\n\n3.\tHave them lodge at an inn, but do not let them hear of the Haunted House yet.\n\n4.\tLet them stay in town, vainly pursuing information and spending their money (according to the list of expenses you have prepared) for a day or two before you arrange for them to hear of the legend of the House - perhaps in casual conversation with the landlord of the inn, with whom they should by then have struck up an affable relationship.\n\n5.\tTell them the Legend and perhaps let the poacher talk to them if you feel this to be appropriate.\n\nOnce they have decided to visit the House, have the innkeeper introduce them to a prominent member of the Town Council so that this august body will be aware of the imminent attempt to stamp out the local menace. The Council will not in any way sponsor the quest at this stage, though there will be hints of rewards if the party accomplishes the task.\n    \nNote: at this time one of the leading personalities of Saltmarsh (who is secretly a 'receiver' for the smugglers) will learn of the party's intent from a casual remark in conversation with a Council member and the assassin will be hurriedly planted (see particularly the notes to part 1, room 15). Have the party equip themselves by dealing with local traders, then let them set out along the old coast road. For part of the way they will be accompanied by encouraging and admiring townsfolk and hero-worshipping children, though the followers will retire to the town as the house looms in view\n\nTHE HOUSE\n\nThe Haunted House stands on the cliff top 70 feet above sea level and about 80 feet from the cliff edge. The 6' high stone wall surrounding the garden has partially collapsed in a number of places, so access to any part of the garden is simple even if the main gate on the cliff road is ignored. This gate, of a heavy and ornate metal construction, is still functional and stands open. The garden itself is overgrown and shows no sign of any care for years. However, any part of the garden and the main earth driveway can be easily traversed. The well to the east of the rear of the House is 5' in diameter and 15' deep with 3' of water at the bottom and a rocky floor. A poisonous snake lives in a hole in the well side about 2' above the floor and will attack anyone who reaches the water level. \n\nSNAKE, Small Viper\n\nHit Dice\t1d8 (4 hit points)\nInitiative\t+3 (Dex)\nSpeed\t20 feet climb, 20 feet swim, 20 feet\nAC\t17 (+1 size, +3 Dex, +3 natural)\nAttacks\tBite +4 melee\nDamage\tBite 1d2 and poison\nSpecial Attacks\tPoison\nSpecial Qualities\tScent\nSaves\tFort +2, Ref +5, Will +1\nAbilities\tStr 6, Dex 17, Con 11, Int 1, Wis 12 Cha 2\nSkills\tBalance +11, Climb +12, Hide +15, Listen +9, Spot +9\nFeats\tWeapon finesse (bite)\nNotes\tPoison: Requires Fortitude save (DC 11). Initial and secondary damage is 1d6 temporary Constitution.\n\tScent: Snakes can scent their prey. They detect creatures within 30 feet and can discern their direction as a partial action.\n\nThe house is 35' high from ground level to roof ridge; the roof is peak-pointed and gabled, with several holes from missing slates. The interior is very dilapidated, damp and with patches of harmless mould everywhere. Cobwebs festoon the place; the woodwork is generally rotten, while dust and dirt are thick and rubbish is scattered about in profusion. Plaster, fallen from ceilings and walls, lies on the floor in several places; many floorboards are loose and some are missing entirely, while there is liberal evidence of rodent and insect infestation. Many rooms have fireplaces and chimneys that show no signs of recent use. The chimneys are too narrow and twisting for anyone to climb.\n\nAll house corridors are 5' wide and 10' high; all rooms are 10' high except for the attic level where, because of the sloping roof, the height ranges from 1' at the sides to 15' in the centre. All doors are 5' wide and 7' high, of normal wood construction; all are closed but unlocked (exception -- see room 15) and easy to open. Most of the windows have panes broken and all are easy to open.\n\nThe passages in the cavern complex are generally about 7-8' wide and 8' high and have a marked, but not precipitous, downward incline. All caverns are roughly 12' high. All walls, ceilings and floors in the caverns and their connecting passages are slimy, wet and discoloured. Light is excellent on the ground and first floors of the House. In the attic, due to sundry holes in the roof, the illumination is dim but adequate though leaving plenty of dark shadows in corners. In areas 20, 23, 24, 25 and 26 there is no light at all. In areas 21, 22, 27, 28 and 29 the light is good since there are torches set in crude brackets on the walls.\n\nWANDERING MONSTERS\n\nNo wandering monsters will be encountered in the garden though there will be numerous small and harmless animals - mice, voles, rabbits and the like. Nor are there any wandering monsters in the cellar, caverns and passages below the House. In the House proper an encounter takes place 1 chance in 12, checking each turn. For each encounter roll d4 and use the listing below:\n\nRoll\tEncounter\n\n1\t4 Goblins\n2\t2 Dire Rats\n3\t2 Giant Worker Ants\n4\t1 Dire Weasel\n\nGOBLIN, Small Humanoid\n\nHit Dice\t1d8 (4 hit points)\nInitiative\t+1 (Dex)\nSpeed\t30 feet\nAC\t15 (+1 size, +1 Dex, +3 studded leather)\nAttacks\tClub +0 melee, javelin +3 ranged\nDamage\tClub 1d6-1, Javelin 1d6-1\nSpecial Qualities\tDarkvision 60 feet\nSaves\tFort +2, Ref +1, Will +0\nAbilities\tStr 8, Dex 13, Con 11, Int 10, Wis 11, Cha 8\nSkills\tHide +6, Listen +3, Move Silently +4, Spot +3\nFeats\tAlertness\n\nAn independent group passing through the locality that has decided to break their journey for a brief treasure hunt; they know nothing about the smugglers.

A Dire Weasel drains blood for 2d4 points of temporary Constitution damage each round that it remains attached. \n\tScent: Dire weasels can scent their prey. They detect creatures within 30 feet and can discern their direction as a partial action.\n\nKEY TO THE GROUND FLOOR OF THE HOUSE\n\n1. ENTRANCE HALL\n\nThe front door opens onto a musty, dirty entrance hall. To your left a corridor leads into the west wing of the house. On either side of the corridor opening the walls are bare but some pieces of wood in the corner near the window indicate that a small wooden table or chair once stood there. Ahead of you, another corridor leads towards the rear of the house. To your right a staircase climbs to the next storey, reaching it at a balcony which overlooks the hall along its north and west sides; the stairs appear safe to climb though the balcony rail is broken in several places. Under the stairs at the rear of the hall a third corridor leads east.\n\nSo long as it is done before the party move into the hall proper, a careful examination of the floor by a character with the tracking feat will reveal two 'paths' along which there has been occasional and recent human movement - one from the foot of the stairs to the corridor towards the kitchen, the other from the foot of the stairs to the western corridor. These have been made by the smugglers when moving between the cellar and their signalling point in room 14. Should the tracks be discovered here and followed in any of the three directions (upstairs to room 14 or to the cellar via either route), a character with the tracking feat will have a 50% chance per turn of losing the track, while other characters will be unable to follow it more than a few yards. Should the party, now or later, ascend the stairs\n\nThe stairs creak ominously as you ascend but they seem safe enough. At the top you reach the gallery which is on the north and west walls of the hall. To east and west the corridor appears to stretch the full width of the house, doors leading off it to the south. Opposite the western portion of the gallery is another corridor leading north. \n\nThe stairs will not collapse under the party's weight but at a point on the gallery 10' to the west of the head of the stairs the floorboards are so rotten that they will collapse if any party member steps on them (the fall causing 1-6 hit points of damage) leaving a gap stretching from the wall clear to the gallery edge and 7' across.\n\n2. LIBRARY\n\nYou can tell that this room was once a library, with bookshelves around the walls. Most of the bookshelves are broken now and in many places have come away from the wall altogether. Those few shelves still intact are empty but there is a pile of books in the southwest corner.\n\nThere are 14 books in the pile untidily thrown into the corner and now covered with cobwebs, vermin droppings and harmless mould. All have been partially spoiled by damp, mould and mice but are still legible. Only three are of any interest, the other eleven being of a routine nature (histories, collections of romantic poems and so forth). These three are clearly titled on the spine:\n\nThe Magical Properties of Gemstones, by Mage Tenser\nThe Magical Properties of Herbs and Flowers, by Mage Tenser\nThe Metaphysics of Mathematics, by Mage Nystul\n\nThese three books can be sold for 150 gp each (though not in Saltmarsh - the vendor will have to seek a larger community if a purchaser is to be found). If the players want their characters to read the books and demand to know something of their contents, the Dungeon Master's imagination may be stretched! Sections of the Dungeon Masters Guide will be helpful  (e.g. page 126). However reading the books will convey no special advantage to the characters and most of their contents will be too obscure for comprehension. Inside the third volume can be found a sheet of parchment obviously torn from a larger sheet, on which are a few lines of handwritten text in the common tongue. It has been spoiled by damp so that only two words are still legible: \"...beyond skeletons...\"\n\nB. STUDY\n\nThis room was once a writing room or study. Against the wall under the windows is a large wooden writing desk partially broken and riddled with dam p rot. There are three drawers in each pedestal and a large central drawer; the latter is closed but the others are all open -- two obviously broken open forcibly.\n\nThe central drawer (which is locked -- the key has been lost for years) contains nothing but valueless documents, all written in the common tongue -- receipts for payments on the purchase of various chemicals and laboratory equipment. A careful search of the cavity in which the central drawer fits will reveal a small secret compartment. Inside, wrapped in cloth, is a glass phial containing a watery, rose-coloured liquid with a spicy aroma (A potion of Neutralise Poison with two doses. See Player’s Handbook page 232 for details of the Neutralize Poison spell). The other drawers are all empty.\n\n4. LIVING AREA I\n\nA door in the north wall leads onto a small paved patio, the paving now cracked and over-run with weeds. There is a pile of refuse in the southeast corner. Otherwise, the room is bare.\n\nThe secret trapdoor in the floor at S (detect as secret door) leads via a staircase down into cellar area 21. A Magic Mouth spell (see Player’s Handbook, page 224) is placed so as to trigger when anyone moves within 5' of the trapdoor. If triggered a voice, coming from the ceiling above, will say \"Welcome, fools -- welcome to your deaths!\" followed by a prolonged burst of insane and fiendish laughter.\n\nDM's option: have each party member make a Will save (DC 12). Failure results in the character suffering the effects of a Fear spell (see Player’s Handbook, page 203). Subsequently each character failing the original save has a 40% chance of being too frightened to re-enter the room.\n\nThe pile of refuse contains nothing of value except a single large gold earring (value 20 gp). Should the party manage to follow the tracks from the entrance hall, they will lead to the trapdoor.\n\n5. LIVING AREA II\n\nThe only thing of any note in the room is a clump of tiny red mushrooms apparently g rowing out of the floor all around the fireplace in a roughly semicircular formation. Otherwise the room is bare.\n\nThe mushrooms are perfectly harmless though their presence may cause any adventurer wishing to step into the fireplace to do so carefully to avoid touching them. Up the chimney, about 3' above the top of the fireplace, is a loose stone concealing a small cavity. Inside the cavity is a small leather pouch containing an amethyst, value 120 gp.\n\n6. LIVING AREA III\n\nThis room is empty. The only matter of interest is that the quantity of fallen plaster on the floor is significantly greater than elsewhere.\n\nThe floors in the two rooms above (see rooms 14 and 15) are considerably weaker than elsewhere. There is nothing else of interest and nothing of value here.\n\n7. DINING ROOM\n\nAt one time a long table stood in the centre of this room; now it lies broken - though still recognisable - on the floor. A broken chair stands against the wall between the windows and there is a heap of broken china in the northwest corner.\n\nThere is nothing of interest or value here.\n\n8. WITHDRAWING ROOM\n\nTwo stuffed armchairs stand near the fireplace of this room. The covers of both have been torn or cut and the stuffing has been pulled out; however, the wooden frames are still intact. The pieces of a broken table lie on the floor near the north wall.\n\nIn the chimney, about 3' above the top of the fireplace, is a loose stone, easily discernable. The cavity behind the stone contains a small metal box; this is locked but the key is nowhere to be found. The box contains a Ring of Protection +1. (The ring offers continual magical protection in the form of a +1 deflection bonus to Armour Class).\n\nA small monstrous spider lives inside the chimney and will attack anyone investigating the loose stone. \n\nSMALL MONSTROUS SPIDER, Small vermin\n\nHit Dice\t1d8 (4 hit points)\nInitiative\t+3 (Dex)\nSpeed\t30 feet, Climb 20 feet\nAC\t14 (+1 size, +3 Dex)\nAttacks\tBite +4 melee\nDamage\tBite 1d4-2 and poison\nSpecial Attacks\tPoison\nSpecial Qualities\tVermin\nSaves\tFort +2, Ref +3, Will +0\nAbilities\tStr 7, Dex 17, Con 10, Int -, Wis 10, Cha 2\nSkills\tClimb +10, Hide +7, Spot +7\nFeats\tWeapon Finesse (bite)\nNotes\tPoison: The spider’s bite is poisonous. Anyone bitten must make a Fortitude save (DC 11). Initial and secondary damage is 1d3 points of temporary Strength.\n\n9. KITCHEN\n\nThis was obviously the kitchen. It is dirty and damp, with patches of grey mould and a few cobwebs on the floor, walls and ceiling. In the corner to your left is some iron cooking equipment with a chimney above. Next to it, under the window, is a cracked and discoloured stone sink. To the right of the sink a small, closed wooden cupboard is fixed to the wall about 5' above floor level. Against the far wall a flight of wooden stairs leads upwards from left to right; even from the door it is obvious that the woodwork is decayed and a few of the treads are missing.\n\nA family of 5 small monstrous centipedes lives in a nest under the floor below the sink, with access to the room via a hole at floor level. They will attack any character coming close to the sink or investigating the cupboard. The cupboard is empty.\n\nSMALL MONSTROUS CENTIPEDE, Small vermin\n\nHit Dice\t1/2d8 (2 hit points)\nInitiative\t+2 (Dex)\nSpeed\t30 feet\nAC\t14 (+1 size, +2 Dex, +1 natural)\nAttacks\tBite +3 melee\nDamage\tBite 1d4-3 and poison\nSpecial Attacks\tPoison\nSpecial Qualities\tVermin\nSaves\tFort +2, Ref +2, Will +0\nAbilities\tStr 5, Dex 15, Con 10, Int -, Wis 10, Cha 2\nSkills\tClimb +5, Hide +13, Spot +7\nFeats\tWeapon Finesse (bite)\nNotes\tPoison: The centipedes are poisonous. Anyone bitten must make a Fortitude save (DC 11). Initial and secondary damage is 1d2 points of temporary Dexterity.\n\n10. SCULLERY\n\nThis room has suffered the effects of damp and decay more than most in the house. Mould grows in patches on the floor, walls and ceiling; there are many cobwebs, though even these appear to be decaying. A large copper boiler, dented, split, discoloured and empty, stands under the window; a small heap of crockery shards is on the floor beside it. Stairs lead down into the darkness of what is presumably a cellar.\n\nA Magic Mouth spell has been cast on the stairs and will be triggered when anyone treads on the top step. If the spell is set off, hideous screams - as if of a soul in torment - will rise from the cellar area below.\n\nDM's option: treat as a fear spell as in Living Area 1, room 4.\n\nKEY TO THE UPPER PART OF THE HOUSE\n\nWhen and if the characters climb the main stairs, refer to the second part of the description of the Entrance Hall, ground floor, Room 1.\n\n11. BEDROOM\n\nWhat was once a fine master bedroom now stands dirty and decayed. Some of the floorboards are missing and there is rubbish scattered around. A tall wooden cupboard stands against the wall opposite the fireplace, its door closed.\n\nThe cupboard contains two items: a pair of old, cracked leather boots with no value or special properties, and a dirty, ragged, stained cloak hanging on a peg. The cloak appears harmless but the inner folds are covered with Yellow Mould, which examination of the cloak will disturb. If the mould is disturbed, all within 10 feet must make a Fortitude save (DC 15) or take 1d6 points of temporary Constitution damage. One minute later, everyone exposed to the initial burst must save again (same DC) or take 2d6 points of temporary Constitution damage.\n\nThere is nothing of value in the room.\n\n12. BEDROOM\n\nOnce perhaps a fine guest bedroom, this is now decayed like the rest of the house. Rubbish is scattered around; there is some evidence of rodent infestation and some webs hang torpid in the corners. A four-poster bed, once a grand piece of furniture, is against the wall opposite the fireplace. Its woodwork is worm-ridden and the curtains that once screened the bed are torn and stained. There is no bed linen, but the carcase of the bed is relatively intact.\n\nThere is nothing of interest or value here.\n\n13. BEDROOM\n\nThis bedroom is dirty and decayed; the floorboards appear intact but rubbish is scattered everywhere and webs are profuse on the walls and ceiling. From the doorway, you can see a glint of light in the fireplace from what appears to be a small, highly reflective object. There is no furniture in here.\n\nThe object in the fireplace is simply a fist-sized chunk of crystal. It has no value though it is superficially attractive. \n\n(Removed two monstrous spiders as repetitive of previous encounter)\n\n14. BEDROOM\n\nAnother dirty, decaying bedroom without furniture. From the doorway the floor in here does not look particularly safe; some floorboards are missing while others appear to have suffered partial collapse.\n\nThe 'safe area' is a 3-5' wide strip from the door down the west wall and across to the window. Adventurers may stand in this area without danger but anyone moving into another part of the room may (60% base chance for a light character, increase incrementally to 100% chance for a very heavy character) precipitate a collapse of the floor, the character falling into room 6 below and taking normal falling damage (1-6 hit points). Refer to Player’s Handbook page 93 for determination of character weight.\n\nIf the party has been able to follow the tracks leading upstairs from the entrance hall (room 1) they will be found to lead into this room, around the safe area and to the window. A combination of the position of the house and the topography of the cliff results in this room providing the best view of the sea from any part of the house, and it is from here that the smugglers signal to their colleagues out at sea. Careful examination of the window area will give small clues to this fact - fresh scratches on the sill where the lantern has been placed, scuffing of the floor dust immediately by the window and so forth. However, these signs cannot be seen from the door; they require close observation for discovery.\n\n15. BEDROOM\n\nThe door to this room appears to be locked or held by some means.\n\nThe lock is a normal one and the key can be found quite easily on the sill of the window at the eastern end of the corridor. The key turns very smoothly and an alert party may deduce that the lock has been oiled recently.\n\nThis is a dirty, decayed bedroom and the floor looks rather unsafe.\n\nThe 'safe area' in here is a 4' strip from the door to the east wall and along that wall to the front of the house.\n\nIn the far corner lies a man; he is obviously alive, though bound and gagged. He is clad only in undergarments and appears to have no weapons or equipment.\n\nThe 'prisoner' is Ned Shakeshaft, a 3rd level rogue. Ned has been 'planted' here, at short notice, by a prominent merchant in Saltmarsh who is secretly a receiver of the smugglers' contraband (see PREAMBLE note). Ned's task is simply to do his utmost to prevent the party from learning about the smuggling operation and generally so to weaken the party - by promoting dissent, causing 'accidents' while not appearing to do so, and so forth - as to lead them to abandon their mission. However, his fear for h is own skin is such that he will not attempt a sneak attack except in the last resort and in circumstances which give him an excellent chance of escaping and/or avoiding detection.\n\nUnfortunately for the merchant, he does not know how to contact the smugglers at short notice - Sanbalet (the smugglers' leader) always initiates their infrequent meetings and never arranges for them to take place in the House. Thus the merchant knows the smugglers' base is somewhere in the House but has never been able to find it. Planting the rogue in one of the upstairs rooms was the best plan he could conceive at short notice. \n\nNed's 'story' is simply that he is a thief from Seaton who entered the House under cover of darkness the previous night to find a place to sleep during his journey to Saltmarsh where, he had heard, there was possible work for adventurers. He entered through the back door and had only reached the kitchen when he was attacked from behind, overcome and knocked unconscious. He awoke some hours ago - bound, gagged and stripped of his possessions - in this room. He did not see his attackers nor, until the party came along, had he heard any sounds in the House. Now he would like to be released and to join the party in their adventure. Neither Ned nor his merchant-mentor are fools and they will have given some rapid thought to preparing this story - it will not be possible for the party to unmask Ned simply. Indeed, to add verisimilitude to the story, Ned will have a lump on the back of his head, inflicted (with some sadistic delight) by the merchant. An alert party may, however, realise fairly soon that Ned is not what he appears to be. Hasty preparations have led the merchant to overlook the fact that Ned's 'imprisonment' will actually draw the party's attention to the probable presence of other people in the house, whereas they might otherwise have found no clue to the smugglers at all.\n\nThe DM must play Ned carefully. Obvious attempts to sow discord or to lead the party into unnecessary danger will 'give the game away' quickly. On the other hand, Ned's instructions are clear, and the more the party make deductions about the presence of the smugglers, the greater will be Ned's efforts to prevent them. If in the final analysis discovery of the smugglers is inevitable, have Ned attempt to sneak attack a party member and make good his escape. Before leaving the room Ned will ask for the loan of clothing and a dagger from the party. As soon as he has the dagger he will exchange it for an envenomed dagger he has hidden in the fireplace (Coated with spider venom. Fortitude save (DC 14); Initial damage 1d4 Strength, Secondary damage 1d6 Strength). If he cannot borrow a dagger, he will retrieve the envenomed blade in any case and do his best to conceal it about his person.\n\nNED SHAKESHAFT, 3rd level Human Rogue\n\nHit Dice\t3d6+3 (16 hit points)\nInitiative\t+7 (+3 Dex, +4 Improved Initiative)\nSpeed\t30 feet\nAC\t13/14 (+3 Dex, +1 Dodge vs. one attack)\nAttacks\t+3 melee weapons, +5 ranged weapons\nDamage\tDagger 1d4+1 (plus poison)\nSpecial Qualities\tSneak Attack +2d6, Evasion, Uncanny Dodge\nSaves\tFort +2, Ref +3, Will +0\nAbilities\tStr 13, Dex 16, Con 12, Int 11, Wis 10, Cha 13\nSkills\tBluff +6, Climb +6, Escape Artist +7, Hide +6, Jump +6, Listen +3, \n\tMove Silently +8, Pick Pocket +6, Search +4, Spot +4\nFeats\tImproved Initiative, Dodge\n\n16. BEDROOM\n\nA large bedroom, now decaying and dirty. Damp mould covers portions of the walls and ceiling and rubbish is strewn liberally round the floor. In the centre is a single mattress which has been badly torn and from which the stuffing protrudes. Under the window is a large wooden chest, the timbers split, its lid closed.\n\nThe mattress contains nothing but stuffing. The chest is not locked and will open easily. Inside is a pile of mouldy ragged clothing -- nothing of value -- and a bundle of documents, mostly mouldy and stained. Most of these documents are old letters that appear to relate to the original purchase of the house; details are unclear, though their general tenor can be deduced. One sheet, towards the bottom of the bundle, is a clerical scroll of Hold Person scribed at 5th level (See Player’s Handbook page 214 for details of the spell). Under the chest is a loose floorboard that conceals a small cavity in the floor. Within the cavity is a small leather bag containing 4 small diamonds, value 25 gp each.\n\n17. BOX ROOM\n\nThis room appears to have been used for storage. A large oak chest stands under the window, its lid closed. Elsewhere in the room are three wooden chairs, all broken, two splintered wooden buckets and a mildewed sack. Just inside the door is a bundle of what looks like clothing; this bundle carries no dust and appears to have been put here recently.\n\nThe chest is empty, while the sack contains old, rotted clothing. The bundle of clothes (which also contains some non-incriminating personal effects, including 11 gp) is the property of Ned Shakeshaft, supposedly imprisoned in room 15.\n\n18. LANDING\n\nAlong the north wall of this area a staircase descends to ground floor of the rear of the house. The treads appear to be insecure.\n\nAnother staircase along the east wall climbs to the upper level. This has mostly collapsed - only the lowest six steps are still intact and there is no easy access to the hole in the ceiling to where the staircase used to lead. A heap of rotten timber lies in the northeast corner.\n\nCloser examination of the staircase down to the kitchen reveals that a few of the treads are missing. These stairs are, however, passable with difficulty, whereas the party will have to find other ways of ascending to the attic if they wish to do so.\n\n19. ATTIC\n\nThe attic is not shown in the house plan. It occupies the entire area under the roof of the House and is thus a large, T-shaped area. As the party enters from area 18...\n\nA gaping hole in the floor shows where the top of the staircase used to lead before its collapse. There are grimy cobwebs on the walls and ceiling and the floor is liberally strewn with dust and rubbish.\n\nSeveral holes in the roof allow dim light to enter this large, dirty room that appears to extend from the back to the front of the House. There are pieces of broken furniture here and there, and rubbish is heaped about the floor. There are two large sacks in the northwest corner. Otherwise there appears to be nothing of interest here.\n\nThe sacks contain old clothing and rags. There is nothing of interest or value in this area. The entry of the party into the attic will alert the Stirges in the southern area, but they will not attack in the northern section; instead they will wait for potential victims to reach the southern area, where they will have more freedom for attack.\n\nAs you approach the southern part of the attic you can see that it appears to extend over the whole of the front portion of the house. It is a storage room where the bric-a-brac of many years has been left. There are more broken pieces of furniture, a few sacks and piles of old clothes, but in general the room appears to contain nothing of interest.\n\nIn the southeast corner, up in the rafters, is a nest of 4 Stirges. The creatures will wait until their victims reach the open area before attacking, though their need for blood is such that they will pursue fleeing victims into the northern area if necessary later. In the Stirges' nest can be found an old, cracked leather purse containing a Quaal’s Feather Token (Whip). When used, the token forms into a large leather whip and wields itself against any target desired. The whip has a base +10 attack bonus and does 1d6+1 of base damage. It has a +1 enhancement bonus to attack and damage, and may make a free grapple attack (at +15 bonus) if it hits. The whip lasts no longer than 1 hour, and may only be used once.\n\nSTRIGE, Tiny Beast\n\nHit Dice\t1d10 (5 hit points)\nInitiative\t+4 (Dex)\nSpeed\t10 feet, Fly 40 feet\nAC\t16 (+2 size, +4 Dex)\nAttacks\tTouch +6\nDamage\tTouch 1d3-4\nSpecial Attacks\tAttach, blood drain\nSaves\tFort +2, Ref +6, Will +1\nAbilities\tStr 3, Dex 19, Con 10, Int 1, Wis 12, Cha 6\nSkills\tHide +14\nFeats\tWeapon Finesse (touch)\nNotes\tBlood Drain: If a stirge hits with a touch attack it uses its eight pincers to latch onto the opponent’s body. An attached stirge has an AC of 12. An attached stirge drains blood, dealing 1d4 temporary Constitution damage each round. Once it has drained 4 points of Constitution it detaches and flies off to digest its meal.\n\nKEY TO THE CELLAR AND CAVERN AREAS\n\nNote the lighting in these areas - see THE HOUSE.\n\n20. WINECELLAR\n\nThis was obviously a wine cellar. Wooden bottle racks -mostly broken -- line the north and west walls to a height of 6. There appear to be no intact bottles left in the racks though there are several with broken necks. Broken bottles cover the floor beneath and near the racks.\n\nAgainst the east wall, at the foot of the stairs, are two large metal storage bins that appear to be empty. In the centre of the room lies a human corpse clad in chain mail; a long sword lies by the corpse's right hand and a large shield lies across the legs.\n\nThe smugglers have long since appropriated the wine and contents of the storage bins. One of the bins now contains some refuse that will prove to be foul smelling if disturbed. In this refuse lives a colony of 18 rot grubs.\n\nThe corpse is that of a fighting man, dead about 3 weeks. His sword and shield are non-magical but his armour is Chain Mail +2. His belt pouch has been cut open and is empty, but there is an emerald worth 250 gp in the hollow heel of his right boot. His body also carries other normal, non-magical items such as a dagger, a backpack containing provisions and so forth. The corpse is infested with 7 rot grubs.\n\nObviously the smugglers have found this body - witness the cut purse. Equally obviously they have decided not to move it but to leave it here in the hope that its presence will deter further exploration by any inquisitive visitor.\n\nShould the party have been successful in following the tracks from the entrance hall, they will lead to the secret door on the south wall.\n\nROT GRUB, Tiny vermin\n\nHit Dice\t1 hit point\nInitiative\t+1 (Dex)\nSpeed\t20 feet\nAC\t13 (+2 size, +1 Dex)\nAttacks\tTouch +0 melee\nDamage\tBurrow\nSpecial Qualities\tBurrow\nSaves\tFort +0, Ref +1, Will +0\nAbilities\tStr 2, Dex 13, Con 10, Int -, Wis 10, Cha 1\nSkills\tJump +5, Hide +5\nNotes\tBurrow: A rot grub leaps onto its intended prey and quickly burrows beneath the skin. It then travels through the flesh towards the prey’s vital organs (brain, heart, etc.), killing the target in 1d4+3 rounds. Each additional grub on the target reduces this time by 1 round (minimum of 2 rounds). A rot grub can be plucked from the target immediately after its initial attack (normal to hit roll required), or it can be burnt from the target’s flesh, causing standard fire damage to the target. A Cure Disease spell instantly kills all rot grubs infesting a target.\n\n21. CELLAR\n\nIf the party penetrates to this area it will be of crucial importance for the DM to determine whether the smuggler in this room (no. 1 on the roster) is aware of the intrusion. Since his position (see below) is such that he is partially turned away both from the stairs to room 4 and from the secret door to room 20, and since a long period of easy crime has made him careless, the smuggler will not notice a quiet, cautious intrusion from either quarter. He cannot, however, fail to notice a noisy entrance and indeed is certain to hear noisy activity either in the lounge or in the wine cellar (including burning away rot grubs, if they attack). Between these extremes, the DM should make a rational judgement.\n\nIf the smuggler is alerted, and if he has time to do so, he will immediately go through the secret door to the cavern area to warn his colleagues. This means that adventurers entering this room might find it empty - whatever Sanbalet's plans to deal with intruders, they will take a little time to initiate. It is at this stage that Ned will, in desperation, attempt a sneak attack in the conviction that the smugglers are about to be discovered.\n\nYou have entered a room that is so unlike anything else you have seen in the House that for a moment you pause, somewhat taken aback. The illumination here is good since several lighted torches are held in shoulder-high brackets around the walls. This was obviously a cellar, but equally obviously it is now used for an entirely different purpose; your first impression is that it is the living quarters for about ten people.\n\nIf the smuggler is present, indicate his presence and position (seated at the north side of the central table, engaged in carving a model boat from a hunk of wood) to the party, together with any immediate actions he takes. If the smuggler is absent, or after he has been dealt with, read the full description of this area.\n\nTen single beds (crude affairs - little more than thin mattresses on boards) stand with heads to the south wall, each with a small wooden locker at its foot. In the centre of the flagged floor is a long wooden trestle table on which there is a variety of cheap metal cutlery and earthenware crockery together with a large jug about half full of a light brown liquid. There are a dozen wooden stools round the table. Against the north wall are two casks, one larger than the other and both broached. The larger one is nearly full of a clear liquid, the smaller one about half full of a light brown liquid. A metal dipper hangs on the outside of the rim of the larger cask.\n\nNext to the casks is a large wooden bin. Above it, hanging on hooks on the wall, are a large ham, a long string of sausages and a small side of meat. Next to the bin is what appears to be a crude, metal wood-fired stove standing in a fireplace. Above the stove, on a shelf, are some iron and earthenware cooking utensils, while next to it is a small pile of logs.\n\nNear the foot of the stairs are two small, unbroached casks; next to them is a bolt of cloth.\n\nThe contents of the room are mostly innocuous. The jug and small broached cask contain cheap ale, the large cask water. The side of meat is salted mutton. The unbroached casks both contain brandy (value 50 gp each) and the bolt is of fine silk (value 100 gp). The lockers, all unlocked, contain only clothing and small personal effects of no value, beyond indicating that all the residents of this room are male and probably human.\n\nThe stove is cool and unlit. The wooden bin contains a considerable food supply -- black bread, dried beans, flour, dried fruit, animal fats, salt and a small amount of honey. See the Appendix for details of the smuggler guard (no. 1 on the roster). If and when the party looks towards the door to room 23, read the following:\n\nThe door to your left appears normal but the one ahead of you has a strong wooden bar across it, carried in brackets on the frame and the door itself. On the door has been written the single word 'DANGER' in the common tongue; this has been inscribed in large letters using chalk.\n\n22. SANBALET'S PRIVATE QUARTERS\n\nThis small room is clearly the quarters of a person senior to those who live in the 'barracks' main room, since the furnishing is less crude and the place is clean and tidy, as if cared for by a servant. There is a comfortable-looking bed in the northwest corner with a wooden locker at its foot. A small wooden table stands against the east wall, and beside it is a padded leather chair. On the table is a brass 9-branch candlestick and in it burn 3 candles, giving the room good illumination. The candles, though not fresh, are far from spent.\n\nUnder the table is a small wooden box and a bullseye lantern with a moveable shutter over the lens; the lantern is unlit. On a shelf above the table are stacked three books. In the northeast corner is a wooden cupboard with the door closed.\n\nThe wooden locker contains clothing and personal effects - nothing of value or of particular interest. The wooden box under the table contains 3 flasks of oil, a tinderbox with flint and steel, 8 new candles and a piece of parchment; this has some curious marks on it which represent the code used by the smugglers to signal to their colleagues out at sea. (For a facsimile and an explanation see the Appendix).\n\nThe books are:\n\n1.\tA volume of erotic poetry, fully illustrated;\n\n2.\tA naval almanac listing tide times for the area of coast containing Saltmarsh (a total of 100 miles of coastline is covered); and\n\n3.\tA learned volume concerning mesmerism and its effects. Inside this book is a sheet of parchment carrying some simple words and phrases in the common tongue and their equivalents in the Gnoll language. Note that unless one of the characters speaks Gnoll it will not be identified as such, but will be \"some foreign language.\"\n\nThe first two items can be sold locally for 10 gp each. The third item is more specialised; it will sell for up to 20 gp but customers are most unlikely to be found in Saltmarsh or any other small town. The sheet of parchment has no monetary value, though it is a curiosity. Examples of the words it carries 'in translation' are \"Stop!\" \"Fight,\" \"Lift\" and so forth - clearly key words used by Sanbalet in instructing his Gnoll slaves.\n\nThe cupboard contains only an oilskin coat hanging on a hook. There is a secret cavity in the underside of the tabletop in which is hidden Sanbalet's spell book. This contains the following spells:\n\nZero level: All Cantrips\nFirst level: Change Self, Colour Spray, Hypnotism, Shield, Silent Image\nSecond level: Ghoul Touch, Invisibility, Magic Mouth, Mirror Image \n\nUnder the bed there is a loose flagstone (detect as concealed portal) above a small cavity. In the cavity there is a small iron box, locked and needle-trapped (the key is in Sanbalet's belt pouch). In the box are five glass phials bedded in wood shavings and a small leather purse containing 11 pp. The phials each contain one draught of a potion: \n\nThree Potions of Cure Light Wounds (pale yellow).\nPotion of Spider Climb (light blue) \nPotion of Haste (deep green). \n\nThe needle of the trap is discoloured, having been tipped with a blue dye. It is not poisonous and has no other harmful effects, but the dye will spread under the skin, forming an obvious blue patch (Sanbalet does not entirely trust his henchmen where such valuables are concerned).\n\n23. SKELETONS' ROOM\n\nThe door to this room is barred (see the last paragraph of the description of room 21). If players ask about the barring, tell them the wooden bar appears to have been in place a long time. The smugglers explored here when they first took over the house as a base, but were frightened by the skeletons and have not ventured to release the bar since.\n\nThis room is dark. Light from the large room behind you spills faintly to show that the room is only about 12' across, but to your left there is only darkness. What little you can see is dingy and dirty.\n\nSix human skeletons occupy this room, placed here by the alchemist to guard his private laboratory. It is some time since they were aroused so they will be a little sluggish to make their initial reaction to intrusion, but they will attack after a short pause.\n\nSKELETONS, Medium-sized undead\n\nHit Dice\t1d12 (6 hit points)\nInitiative\t+5 (+1 Dex, +4 Improved Initiative)\nSpeed\t30 feet\nAC\t13 (+1 Dex, +2 Natural)\nAttacks\t2 claws +0 melee\nDamage\tClaw 1d4\nSpecial Qualities\tUndead, Immunities\nSaves\tFort +0, Ref +1, Will +2\nAbilities\tStr 10, Dex 12, Con -, Int -, Wis 10, Cha 11\nFeats\tImproved Initiative\nNotes\tUndead: Skeletons are immune to mind-influencing effects as well as poison, paralysis, stunning and disease. They are not subject to critical hits, subdual damage, ability damage, energy drain or death from massive damage. \n\tImmunities: Skeletons have cold immunity. Because they lack flesh or internal organs they take half damage from slashing and piercing weapons.\n\n24. LABORATORY\n\nAssuming the party provides some illumination when they open the secret door:\n\nThe secret door opens towards you to reveal, piled on the floor of this room, a clutter of old and broken glass and earthenware. There are three small copper pots amidst the debris and these appear to be intact.\n\nThere is nothing of value in this debris piled by the north wall of the laboratory. As the party gets a view of the rest of the room...\n\nA bench runs down the west wall of what was obviously a laboratory. On the bench are various jars of powders and liquids and several pieces of chemical apparatus, some stained in different colours as the liquids they contained dried up long ago.\n\nThere is a table against the south wall, forming an i-shape with the bench. In the chair before the table sits a human figure with its back to you, apparently studying a book that is open on the table. The figure wears a robe, embroidered with a variety of mystic symbols, and a pointed hat. On the table is a candlestick, a tiny stump of unlit candle remaining in it, and a variety of other items which, even in the dim light, shine with the warmth of pure gold. One of these objects looks like a human skull.\n\nThe figure is the skeleton of the alchemist and original owner of the House struck dead during his work by a heart attack. Before the alchemist died he was reading the book that lies open on the table. Its title is Ye Secret of Ye Philosopher's Stone, no author acknowledged. The book is very valuable and any alchemist will gladly pay 500 gp for it (though the party will have to travel to a larger centre of population than Saltmarsh to find a customer). In the main, the book is too profound and recondite a work to be understood by anyone other than the appropriate specialist (and even that specialist would have to be very learned), but the party will be able to deduce the general subject matter. Broadly, the book instructs on the making of a 'Philosopher's Stone', then describes how that stone can be used to convert base metal into gold. Words like 'stone’, 'gold’, 'transmuting' and so forth will be recognisable and will recur frequently - the DM must decide how quickly and how accurately the party can deduce the tenor of the book's contents.\n\nThe golden objects are in fact of pure gold. So far as the party is aware, these objects are the results of several successful experiments. They are:\n\nA human skull, value 750 gp\nAn apple, value 150 gp\nA rose, value 150 gp\nA set of five small discs (actually balance weights), value 50 gp in total.\n\nA secret drawer in the table contains the alchemist's spell book (he was a genuine magic-user), but the book has been badly damaged at some time and the only spells still legible are:\n\nFirst level: Affect Normal Fires, Find Familiar, Magic Weapon\nSecond level: Fools’ Gold, Glitterdust\nFifth level: Animate Dead\n\nThe skeleton wears a leather belt pouch in which there are 47 gp. In the clenched left fist of the skeleton can be found a smooth, ovoid pebble about 4 ounces in weight and having a lustrous pale gold colour. It emits a faint glow (as well as dweomer) if detect magic is cast on it. Though the party might assume it is the Philosopher's Stone, it is in fact a cursed luckstone that will elect as its 'owner' the first character to handle it. It cannot be thrown or given away as it will always, within the hour, return magically to the owner without his or her knowledge, turning up in a pocket, belt pouch or whatever. No type of physical blow will harm it; nor will cold, heat, electricity or acid. The owner will suffer a penalty of -1 from all 'to hit' rolls, damage rolls and saving throws while the stone is possessed (even if it is temporarily absent). A Remove Curse spell cast on the stone will cause it to vanish absolutely and forever. An alchemist will recognise that this is not the Philosopher's Stone but will know nothing else of it, nor will the luckless owner be able to persuade anyone to buy it. The chemical apparatus and materials on the bench are of no particular interest or value.\n\nTHE PASSAGES AND CAVERNS\n\nThe passages and caverns beyond the secret door in the south wall of room 21 all decline perceptibly towards the sea. The main passage plus areas 27, 28 and 29 are all well lit by torches set into crude brackets on the walls. Areas 25 and 26 are dark. Area 30 is open to daylight (when working there at night, the smugglers take care to conceal their lights). The passage and cavern walls are wet and slimy and the floors are moist, though the smugglers have laid coarse matting in various places along the main passage to the sea in an effort to make it more easily passable.\n\nAll these passages and caverns are natural, though there are signs of human working here and there - the stairs immediately by the secret door, for instance, and in places where an inconveniently narrow passage has been widened. The DM should remember that Sanbalet is acutely conscious of the need to keep the secret door in the south wall of area 21 secret. The smugglers therefore take great care to clean up all tracks inside the room. However, when the party reaches the foot of the stairs it will be obvious that the passages to areas 25 and 26 are not much used.\n\nNote that if smugglers are unaware of intrusion, they will be found in the approximate positions stated in the text that follows. However if they have been alerted, their positions will change as they execute Sanbalet's orders.\n\n25. NATURAL CAVERN\n\nYour lights show a natural cavern, roughly circular and about 20-25' in diameter. There appears to be nothing of interest here.\n\nAt a point on the ceiling roughly halfway between the two passage mouths is a large green slime that will almost certainly (95% chance) drop on the party if they pass below. Green slime attaches itself to living flesh and in 1-4 melee rounds turns the victim into green slime (no resurrection possible). It can be scraped off quickly, excised, frozen or burned. A cure disease spell kills green slime. Other spells and physical attacks do it no harm.\n\n26. NATURAL CAVERN\n\nYour lights show a natural cavern, roughly circular and 25-30' in diameter. There appears to be nothing of interest here.\n\nThe appearance is accurate - there is nothing of interest in the cavern.\n\n27. NATURAL CAVERN\n\nThis cavern, like the passage leading to it, is well lit by torches held in brackets round the walls. Stacked against the wall to your left, as you enter, you can see five small bolts of cloth, while to your right are eight small casks in a neat row.\n\nUnless they have previously been alerted, there will be two humans and two Gnolls in this cavern. The first human is Sanbalet, the smuggler chief and a 4th level wizard (specialist Illusionist). He is checking a manifest of contraband received the previous night as his assistants carry it up from the sea. A human smuggler (no. 2 on the roster) is assisting his chief in checking inventory. \n\nThe Gnolls are under Sanbalet's hypnotic influence; they will unquestioningly obey him as their master, and they cannot be coerced or charmed into betraying him. (Note that the hypnotism is not the result of the spell of the same name. Sanbalet has some mastery of non-magical mesmerism as a result of reading his book in room 22.)\n\nSANBALET - 4th level human wizard (illusionist)\n\nHit Dice\t4d4+4 (15 hit points)\nInitiative\t+3 (Dex)\nSpeed\t30 feet\nAC\t13 (+3 Dex)\nAttacks\tDagger +2 melee\nDamage\tDagger 1d4\nSaves\tFort +2, Ref +4, Will +4\nAbilities\tStr 10, Dex 16, Con 12, Int 16, Wis 10, Cha 14\nSkills\tConcentration +9, Hide +5, Knowledge (Arcana) +10, Move Silently +5, Scry +7, \n\tSearch +5, Spot +2, Spellcraft +10\nFeats\tScribe Scroll, Spell Focus (Illusion), Toughness\nSpells memorized\t0) Dancing Lights, Daze, Ghost Sound, Resistance\n\t1) Colour Spray, Hypnotism, Shield, Silent Image\n\t2) Ghoul Touch, Invisibility, Mirror Image \nNotes\tSanbalet wears an old, faded robe and soft shoes. An old leather belt round his waist carries two daggers (the one he normally uses is in a sheath strapped to his left forearm, concealed by the sleeve of his robe) and a belt pouch containing 7 gp, 5 sp, 3 ep, the key to his chest, a set of 'loaded' dice and three gems each worth 250 gp. \n\nGNOLL, Medium-sized Humanoid\n\nHit Dice\t2d8+2 (11 hit points)\nInitiative\t+0\nSpeed\t20 feet (Scale mail), base 30 feet\nAC\t17 (+1 natural, +4 Scale, +2 large shield)\nAttacks\tBattleaxe +3 melee\nDamage\tBattleaxe 1d8+2\nSpecial Qualities\tDarkvision 60 feet\nSaves\tFort +4, Ref +0, Will +0\nAbilities\tStr 15, Dex 10, Con 13, Int 8, Wis 11, Cha 8\nSkills\tListen +3, Spot +3\nFeats\tPower Attack\n\nIf the smugglers, alerted to the party's intrusion earlier, stage an attack, the Gnolls will be at the front. One Gnoll has a gold bracelet on its arm (value 75 gp). Each bolt is of silk and valued at 100 gp. Each cask contains brandy and is valued at 50 gp.\n\n28. SLOPING PASSAGE\n\nThe incline of the passage is perceptibly greater in this and coarse matting has been laid in various places on the floor. The passage narrows to 5-6' in places.\n\nIf the smugglers are unaware of the party's intrusion, three of them will be found in this area, each carrying contraband up the slope to area 27. The first (no. 3 on the roster) just north of the right-angle bend, carries a small cask of brandy (value 50 gp). The third (no. 5 on the roster) is some 20' behind the second and carries a small cask of brandy (value 50 gp). See the Appendix for details of the smugglers.\n\n29. NATURAL CAVERN\n\nThe passage widens to the south at this point to form a small cavern. There are three bolts of cloth and five small casks in the middle of the floor, resting on a piece of coarse matting\n\nThe bolts and casks are, as before, worth 100 gp and 50 gp each respectively. The other three human smugglers are here taking a rest before continuing the transportation of the contraband. One (no. 6 on the roster) is about to lift one of the bolts of silk. The others (nos. 7 and 8 on the roster) are obviously reluctant to continue their work for a few moments and are squatting with their backs to the east wall.\n\n30. SEA CAVE\n\nThe passage leads into a cave that opens directly to the sea. The tide is out at present and there is little water in the cave, but there is an obvious high water mark that in places is 3' above the floor. Pulled up onto the sloping cave floor is a small boat - perhaps large enough for eight men - with oars, a step-down mast and a neatly furled sail. A rope tied to the bow has been weighed down by a large boulder that serves as an anchor.\n\nThere is nothing of value here apart from the jolly boat that might fetch as much as 90 gp in Saltmarsh. There is nothing aboard apart from the normal tackle. Since bolts of silk and casks of brandy are cumbersome as well as heavy, the party may well use this boat to transport the contraband to Saltmarsh.\n\nCONCLUDING NOTES\n\nShould the party succeed in wiping out the smuggling ring, a grateful Saltmarsh Town Council will vote them a reward of 500 gp per surviving party member. Should they also succeed in killing or capturing Sanbalet, the reward will be doubled. They will be allowed to keep any treasure they find but will not get full value for silk and brandy in Saltmarsh - they will be asked, politely but firmly, to pay 25% excise duty on the value of any contraband, thus retaining only 75% for themselves. (The DM should note behaviour of the characters at this point - lawful characters should pay without hesitation!)\n\nThe party will need to rest and recuperate for a while before they can pursue the second part of this module. Again, ensure they pay for their food, accommodation and other living expenses before they are invited by the Town Council to the meeting that starts the next adventure.\n\nTHIS CONCLUDES THE FIRST PART OF THE SINISTER SECRET OF SALTMARSH.\n\nPART TWO - THE SEA GHOST\n\nWherein the plot is unravelled...and thickens.\n\nPREAMBLE\n\nA few days after their triumphant return from the destruction of the smugglers' ring at the Haunted House, the party is hastily summoned to an emergency meeting of the Saltmarsh Town Council. Here it is explained to them that, though the land-based operation of the smuggling ring has been quashed, there must be a seagoing vessel by which the contraband was originally conveyed and this is still at large. The City Fathers, fearful that any surviving smugglers may seek to re-establish their operation from some other base, wish to apprehend this vessel and so put an end, once and for all, to the smuggling. (If, for whatever reason, the party actually failed to return from the Haunted House, this second adventure is suitable for a medium-sized party (5-10 characters) of 1-3 experience levels each.\n\nThe party is asked to undertake this task and, as an inducement, a reward of 500 gp is offered to each member of the party for the successful conclusion of the mission (they may of course keep whatever other loot they find). It is reasoned by the Council that the surviving smugglers on the vessel will, as yet, be unaware of the capture and/or death of their land based colleagues, and a return visit by them with a further cargo of contraband may well be expected. As the last consignment was off-loaded only a short while ago, the next is not reasonably to be expected for some time, probably during the next 'dark of the moon' which begins in about two weeks time. \n\nThe Council will arrange for two local men from a part-time corps of 'excise officers' to patrol the potential rendezvous points each night for the next two weeks in case the smugglers return earlier than expected. However, their resources are slight and the Council is unwilling to risk the lives of volunteers by ordering them to take the ship and its crew by force - they anticipate the smugglers would put up a fight to protect themselves and their cargo, and could easily overpower a couple of local men. The proposal is therefore that the excise men will undertake a patrol each night but that as soon as an approaching vessel is spotted, the party should perform the actual task of boarding, the excise men going with them for added support.\n\nNote: if you wish to play in this adventure, read no further! What follows is for the eyes of the Dungeon Master only! For the information of the Dungeon Master (only) a summary of the plot of this module is given in the Appendix.\n\nPREPARATIONS\n\nThe Dungeon Master should allow intelligent participation by party members in the Council meeting and reward it appropriately. For example, if they have deduced or inferred that there is normally a signalling arrangement between the two groups of smugglers, they may wish to arrange for a prompt response from the House to any light signal from the ship; if so, experience points should be awarded to the player making the suggestion, and the reward should be proportionately greater if correct deductions are made about the code on the parchment in Sanbalet's room. The Dungeon Master must exercise considerable discretion in this. Too small a reward, or none at all, could inhibit creative thinking by the party, while overgenerous rewards quickly become self-defeating. Once the party accepts the undertaking, the Council will put a small fishing boat at their disposal and provide them with any reasonable amount of non-magical equipment that they feel they may require. The boat is large enough to accommodate the entire party plus the two local volunteers. \n\nThe Council will also provide the services of two of their excise men, a corporal and a private, to accompany the party and sail the boat for them. The characteristics of these men and of the cutter are fully detailed in the Appendix. The local men will fight hard and courageously and, though they will not undertake actions of a suicidal nature at the behest of party members, they will carry out their nightly patrols efficiently and regularly and will advise members of the party of the approach of the ship. Presumably the party members will make prior arrangements for a suitable course of action at this time - how the men are to signal the ship's arrival, where they are to pick up the party in the boat and so forth; if they fail to make such advance plans, the corporal will (respectfully) suggest they do so!\n\nAgain, the party may determine the general area within which the nightly patrols are to be carried out, but if not the corporal will offer his opinion on the matter (which will be correct) - that the general area to be patrolled should be about half a mile or so out to sea and in line of sight of the old Haunted House. Clever party members will seek beforehand to see plans and designs of typical sea-going vessels of this time and place in order to obtain some prior understanding of the type of 'dungeon' they will be entering.  Though the Dungeon Master must never volunteer this information a rough description should be provided at the party's request. However, the DM should include a number of differences from the Sea Ghost's actual layout - different cabin arrangements, variations in dimensions, doors and hatches in different places etc. After all, ships of this kind are not made to a rigidly prescribed design! On no account should the presence of the secret doors/cabins be revealed or even hinted at.\n\nSPECIAL NOTES ABOUT RUNNING THIS ADVENTURE\n\nMuch of what has already been said in relation to the first part of this module should apply equally to the adventure aboard the Sea Ghost. In particular, remember that the crew on the ship - with the exception of those who are on deck signalling and watching for the return signal - do not have fixed posts but are mobile, going about their routine preparations for off-loading cargo. If the party's presence aboard the vessel goes undetected by those below-decks, the adventurers should find it quite a simple task to take the smugglers unaware, either singly or in small groups as they go about their business. On the other hand, if the alarm is raised don't forget that the smugglers know the ship's layout intimately and will be able to organise a swift and perhaps unexpected reprisal.\n\nDuring the time spent on patrol the weather will be fine and clear although when there is no moon, light will be poor and normal vision obscured beyond twenty feet. The ship will arrive, as predicted, during the dark moon period. The party is to receive the benefit of favourable winds, tides and currents as the objective is to get them aboard the smugglers' ship and not involve them in a complicated exercise involving the finer points of seamanship and navigation. Besides, the local men are in fact a fisherman and his brother (both experienced sailors) and quite capable of dealing with these matters expeditiously.\n\nOn no account is the Dungeon Master to inform the players that the smugglers are running arms to the lizard men (see THE PLOT in the Appendix) as well as dealing in contraband. They must discover this for themselves as they play through the module, by the presence of the lizard men aboard the ship, by finding the Aquatic Elf prisoner and learning what he knows, by deciphering the special chart and letter in the captain's cabin, by finding the secret cache of weapons and by putting all these clues together to come up with the correct conclusions. Additionally, captured smugglers can be bribed or threatened for information (watch alignment behaviour if coercion is suggested or actually used!). Should all this fail to trigger the correct conclusions then the Dungeon Master may, at the end of the adventure, be forced to 'give away' the arms-running information, if only to ensure that the party is tempted to continue adventuring in modules U2 and U3. The method of revealing this information must be left at the discretion of the DM who is luckless enough to be dealing with an obtuse bunch of players!\n\nTHE SIGNALLING SYSTEM\n\nThe signalling system is simple but effective (see Appendix for the signals). The arrangement is for someone aboard the ship to flash the first signal (which takes about four seconds) up to three times within a period of one minute. The shore party would reply with the second signal and would flash this twice, whereupon the third signal would be flashed once only from the ship, and the unloading operation would begin. A pair of smugglers would row the jolly boat out from shore to the ship at the same time as a ship's boat is dropped, and these two vessels would alternate in carrying the contraband ashore, one of them remaining in the shore cave at the end of the operation.\n\nIt has been arranged (though this does not appear on the parchment) that the first signal should be repeated at intervals of 10 minutes (three times in each case) for an hour. If there is no response from the shore, it will be assumed that there is some problem ashore and the Sea Ghost will sail away, returning the next night to repeat the procedure. If the response from the shore is not the agreed one, the first signal will be repeated after the requisite 10 minutes, and if the response is again incorrect the Sea Ghost will depart, again returning the next night to repeat the procedure.\n\nThe local men in the fishing boat will each have an automatic 20% chance per signal burst to see the first signal; party members, whether in the house, on the cliff or in the cave, must first indicate to the Dungeon Master, by their words and/or behaviour, that they are indeed actively looking for the vessel. If any players are being inattentive during play, then these players' characters will have no chance at all to see the signal light; others will have a 15% chance each per signal burst of making a sighting.\n\nBOARDING THE SEA GHOST\n\nHow long it takes the party to reach the ship depends on what arrangements they have made beforehand with the excise men. If, for example, it is arranged that the excise men, once they have seen the ship, will row ashore and pick the party up (say in the cave below the Haunted House), that will take about 15-20 minutes. The party would then board the fishing boat that would be rowed out towards the ship. The journey direct to the ship would take about 30-40 minutes (20-30 minutes with more than two rowing), but if the boat is to approach the Sea Ghost from the seaward side another five minutes should be added. The ship will be lying broadside to the coastline, the starboard side facing landwards and if the characters approach her from this side they will automatically be seen when within 20', even if they approach silently and without light.\n\nIf the party approaches darkly and silently from the port side they will be totally unobserved - the smugglers on deck are watching the coast from the starboard side, and will not see or hear intruders unless there is a light in the boat or noise from it. Thus, whether the alarm is raised or not will depend on a number of factors: from which direction the boat approaches the ship, whether the watchers on the ship are alerted to possible danger (an incorrect response to the signal or no response at all) and whether the party has taken precautions to conceal its approach (no lights, muffled rowlocks, a silence spell, etc.). Between the extremes outlined above (automatic detection of a direct approach, no detection of a silent and dark approach from the seaward side) the DM must judge the circumstances, decide on the probability of detection and determine the outcome by rolling dice against that probability.\n\nIf the party makes a direct approach, they may try to bluff their way aboard once they have been detected. For instance, they may say they are a party from the Haunted House base, that the lamp has been accidentally smashed, that a new recruit to the gang, unused to the codes, has made a mistake with the signalling, or something of a similar nature. If the story is reasonably convincing, allow them a 65% or greater chance of being believed up to the point when the first three members of the party actually get aboard via a rope ladder which will be lowered for them. Once these three are aboard, the deception will automatically be discovered - the smugglers will take alarm and will attempt to repel the boarders while at the same time getting their vessel under way. A detected approach will mean that the entire crew will attempt to repel boarders with the utmost vigour.\n\nEven if the party's approach is not detected, they must still get aboard. The most obvious method is to climb the anchor chain that will be easy for relatively unencumbered characters (no chance of slipping and falling) while for characters with heavy gear there will be a 10%-25% chance (depending on the encumbrance) of slipping and falling into the sea (in which case the character must be pulled to safety within one melee round or sink and drown in four rounds). The watchers on deck will hear the noise of a character falling into the sea unless it is covered by (for instance) a silence spell. Other means of boarding may be attempted. The DM must determine the outcome according to the circumstances. Characters may, if they so elect, try  to climb onto any of the three deck areas, through either or both of the open portholes in the stern, or even onto the bowsprit, but note that anyone climbing up the rigging will probably (70% chance) be noticed (and fired on!) by the smuggler in the crow's nest (see below).\n\nOf course, if the party gains undetected access to the ship and the requisite signalling period passes, then the anchor will be raised and the Sea Ghost will sail away. The fishing boat is not as fast as the Sea Ghost so attempts to pursue by anyone left in the boat will be fruitless.\n\nFEATURES OF THE SMUGGLERS' SHIP\n\nThe name of the vessel, 'Sea Ghost', is painted on both sides of the prow. She has a length of nearly 90', a beam of 26', a draught of 8' and stands 9' above the waterline to the top of her main deck rails and 17' above the waterline to the top of both her forecastle and poop rails. All doors are 6' high, 4' wide and of stout wood construction; all are normally shut but none are locked and all can be readily opened without die rolling. All secret doors may be detected in the same way as normal secret doors. All portholes are 2' square and have no glass, being simply square openings cut into the ship's timbers which can be closed and fastened from the inside by hinged and bolted wooden hatches; all are closed and bolted except for the two in the ship's stern which give onto areas 8 and 9. Crawling through the stern portholes can be managed by all creatures of sizes S and M, but only gnomes and halflings may do so freely; all other races must rid themselves of their shields and extraneous gear and contrive to either push or pull these items ahead or after them.\n\nThe stairways leading down from area 1 to areas 12 and 13 are separated from each other by a stout wood partition and take the form of wood-enclosed companionways so that they are completely sealed off from areas 8 and 9, while the stairway from area 1 to area 10 is likewise enclosed in wood partitions and sealed off from area 6. All enclosed areas have a height of 8' except for the bilge (area 16) that is 4' high. The cargo hold hatch in area 1 is closed but not fastened. The bilge hatch in area 11 is closed and bolted from the hold side only. Above decks (when the party arrives) the light is poor and normal vision is obscured to within a 20' range; below decks there is no light at all except for area 1 1 where a single lit lantern, hanging from the centre ceiling, provides normal illumination. Smugglers moving around below decks will carry a lantern each. \n\nThe Sea Ghost is mainly of wood construction so that fire is always something of a hazard. She could, with some difficulty, be set ablaze and burnt down to the waterline. However, it is not to be imagined that the vessel will burn readily for her hull, rigging, spars and sails are all in varying degrees of dampness. Deliberate attempts to set her ablaze may only be undertaken while aboard her. This will involve the use of at least two flasks of oil to two cubic feet of dry combustible materials such as sacking, cloth, wool or wood kindling and still has only a 60% chance of successfully creating a blaze. Additional flasks of oil and combustibles will increase the chances by 10% for each extra flask of oil plus a further cubic foot of combustibles. Brandy-soaked silk bolts make excellent combustibles and do not require the addition of oil to ignite. It will take a full turn before the fire takes hold, during which period it may be extinguished with a 15% chance for every person helping in the attempt. On the second turn after ignition the chance of successfully extinguishing the fire goes down to 10% per person involved; on the third turn the fire will be out of control and will burn the ship down to the waterline in a further turn. In the event of successful extinguishment the Dungeon Master has discretion to decide the extent of damage to the ship, cargo and, possibly, other treasures, and reduce their values accordingly.\n\nSpells of third level and above which involve the creation of fire have a 25% chance per use of creating a blaze; the chances of extinguishing it remain the same as those for a normal fire. Fire spells below third level will not create a fire hazard to the ship, nor will attempts with normal fire if undertaken by characters not aboard her. Throwing torches and lanterns onto the ship from the fishing boat will serve no useful purpose and will certainly alert the smugglers. Attempts to hole the ship and so sink her will require the use of axes and/or similar implements applied with force and vigour. The time necessary to complete this undertaking will be four rounds and the noise will be sufficient to alert the smugglers. Two of them will be sent to investigate and will raise the alarm at the end of the second melee round; the rest of the crew will then rapidly converge to that area and attack any intruders there by the end of the fourth melee round.\n\nThe fishermen and smugglers, but not the lizard men or the wizard Punketah, can climb the rigging and move along the spars and yards with complete success and mobility; all others must roll a Climb skill check versus DC 11 to succeed. Failure means a fall with a 50% chance of going either into the sea (those wearing armour or otherwise encumbered sink within one melee round and drown in four) or onto the deck (roll 1d6 for damage per 10' fallen). Fighting, when aloft, will be as normal for all excise men, lizard men, smugglers and party members with a Climb skill. Others, including the wizard Punketah, will have -2 on their 'to hit' die rolls and their armour class will deteriorate by one factor, though not lower than AC 10. All missile attacks aloft will, due to the poor light, be at a basic -1 'to hit' for characters with normal vision (-2 if the character lacks a Climb or seamanship skill). It will not be possible for any character to employ both shield and weapon (or any two-handed weapon) at the same time while aloft; nor will it be possible to cast spells other than those with a verbal component only. Note the presence of the crow's nest (area 17) and its occupant. The main rigging is shown in the rigging diagram.\n\nSURRENDER BY THE SMUGGLERS\n\nIf and when the ship's Captain, the Mate, the Bosun and the wizard are all dead or have fled, and if the party then outnumbers the surviving crewmen and lizard men combined, then the human smugglers will offer to surrender the ship to the party. They will seek the most advantageous terms they can get, but their minimum requirements will be their lives and liberty and the ship's jolly boat in which to flee. If the party refuses these minimum conditions then the smugglers will offer to trade information in exchange for treasure. Again, they will seek the most advantageous terms they can obtain and their minimum requirements, in this case, will be 100 gp to disclose the whereabouts of the secret cache of weapons and the fact they were to deliver these arms to the lizard men. They do not know the exact location of the rendezvous point for their arms running, only that it is about ten miles or so along the coast and west of the Haunted House, near the mouth of a small river. For a further minimum amount of 50 gp they will reveal the presence of the Aquatic Elf prisoner in area 14.\n\nIf the party refuses to meet any of these minimum demands, the smugglers will refuse the related information. They know nothing of importance other than stated above. The smugglers' leaders and the lizard men will not surrender or sell information; they will either fight to the death or, if things are going very badly for them, seek to escape either in the jolly boat or by diving overboard and swimming to the shore (shedding armour and equipment as necessary).\n\nRANDOM ENCOUNTERS ABOARD THE SEA GHOST\n\nThere will be no random encounters other than aboard the ship. No sea monsters, etc., will plague the excise officers on patrol or the party on its way to the boarding attempt. The Dungeon Master must keep in mind that the smugglers are a successful band of organised and intelligent criminals, and their behaviour must reflect this at all times. Once they become aware of the presence of intruders aboard their ship, they will react in an aggressive, efficient and organised manner to seek out and subdue or slay the intruders. They will not be content to simply remain in their respective starting areas, but will rouse their comrades, band together and actively seek out party members. In this event the Random Encounters table should no longer be used.\n\nRandom encounters aboard the ship will be with persons and /or creatures also based in specific encounter areas. Thus if a smuggler is killed or captured as a 'wanderer' he will not be found in his normal encounter area, nor may he occur again as a 'random encounter'. Conversely if a smuggler is killed or captured in his encounter area he cannot later be involved in a random encounter. Because of the small size and restricted nature of the ship, there is one chance in eight each turn of a random encounter. If a random encounter is indicated, roll d6 and check the following table to show who has been encountered.\n\nRoll\tEncounter\n\t\n1-2\tMate, Smuggler 1 \tBoth in area 1\n3-4\tBosun, Smuggler 2, Smuggler 3\tAll in area 11\n5-6\tMagic-User, lizard man 2\tArea 3, area 7\n\nSee the Appendix for complete details of these characters and creatures. If an encounter rolled at random makes obvious nonsense in the prevailing circumstances ignore it and treat it as no encounter. If, for instance, the DM has judged that the party has managed to board the forecastle (area 2) without being detected, then a random encounter is indicated with the mate and smuggler on the main deck, who are still in fact looking landward to await a signal, then ignore it and treat it as 'no encounter’.\n\nKEY TO THE SEA GHOST\n\n1. MAIN DECK\n\nThough the light is not good, you can see that this is the ship's main deck. In the centre, forward of the mast, is a jolly boat apparently lashed to the deck with ropes.\n\nAft of the mast is a raised area -- perhaps something lying on the deck or a hatchway to the below-decks area. In the corners formed by the forward upper deck and the port rail, and by the aft upper deck and the starboard rail there appear to be smallish objects lying on the deck. Aft of the area provisionally identified as a hatchway you can see a diagonal line going upwards - presumably a rope ladder to a crow's nest above.\n\nLeaning against the rail, about midway along this deck, are two human figures. They appear to be staring towards the coast. Between them and at deck level is what appears to be perhaps a roll of cloth, canvas or rope.\n\nTo fore and aft, below the upper decks, are vague outlines of doors. You can also see ladders that lead to the upper decks, the aft one on the port side, and the forward one on the starboard.\n\nThe raised area to stern of the mast is indeed the hatch that leads to the hold (area 11) below. The smallish objects on the deck are 25' lengths of rope, neatly coiled. The object between the two men is a rope ladder, 25' long, at present neatly coiled but ready to be thrown over the side. The two men (who, unless they are aware of the party's intrusion, will be looking towards the House, waiting for a signal) are the ship's Mate 'Bloody' Bjorn and smuggler no. 1 (see the Appendix for full details of these two men). See also the note below the description of area 3.\n\n2. FORECASTLE\n\nThe deck area is dominated by a massive shape in the centre that you can identify as the ship's capstan. From it, the anchor chain runs down the chain vent to port of the prow.\n\nStanding just to starboard of the prow and leaning against the bowsprit is a human figure. He appears to be scanning to starboard.\n\nThe man in view is smuggler no. 4 (see the Appendix for full details). Depending on the exact position of the observer it may be possible to discern details of area 1 (q.v.). See also the note below the description of area 3. Note that the capstan arms can be removed and might be used as clubs. They have been left in the capstan by express orders of the Captain who wants to be able to make a quick get-away if this should prove necessary.\n\n3. POOP DECK\n\nThe tiller is the most obvious feature of this area, rising from the deck about 6' from the stern and having a horizontal arm some 6' long. Against this arm, on the starboard side and apparently looking coastwards, leans a human figure.\n\nLeaning on the starboard rail and looking towards the coast are three human figures. The one nearest the stern seems to be holding something in his hand at shoulder level; occasionally he seems to adjust it in  some way.\n\nThe man leaning against the tiller bar is smuggler no. 6. The others, from fore to aft, are the magic-user Punketah, the ship's captain Sigurd 'Snake Eyes' and smuggler no. 5. The latter holds a bullseye lantern that has a signalling shutter over its lens; from time to time he moves the shutter as he gives the prearranged signal.\n\nNOTE: if the agreed period of signalling is over by the time an invading party observes areas 1, 2 or 3, the positions of the smugglers will have changed. The captain (having given orders to set sail) and the magic-user will have returned to their respective cabins, while the mate will be organising smugglers nos. 1, 4, 5 and 6 in their tasks preparatory to sailing. Smugglers 2, 3 and 7, with the bosun, will be on their way to the main deck from area 11 via area 10. In extreme circumstances the party may not arrive and be in a position to observe until the ship is on the point of getting under way, in which case all the smugglers plus the mate and bosun will be on deck and going about their various tasks.\n\n4. GALLEY STORES\n\nFrom iron hooks set into the ceiling hang three long strings of sausages, a large ham and a hunk of meat. Against the hull are three sacks. Set against the bulkhead beside the door are a cask and a ceramic jar. Against the other bulkhead are set a large and a small  cask and another ceramic jar. There is an opening in the latter bulkhead about 3' square and with its lower edge about 3' above the deck. There seems to be nothing of value here and the area is apparently unoccupied.\n\nThe meat is salt beef, the sacks contain dried beans, the casks contain flour, salt and ale respectively. The jars contain honey and olive oil respectively.\n\n5. SHIPS STORES\n\nTwo coiled lengths of rope and three rolls of sailcloth lie on the deck alongside a large box. A large wooden cask stands next to six lengths of wood planking. Set into a wooden rack, fastened to the bulkhead by the door are two metal-headed hammers, two wooden mallets, two saws and an adze. There is an opening, about 3' square and with its lower edge about 3' above the deck, in the other bulkhead. There seems to be nothing of value here and the area is apparently unoccupied.\n\nEach rope is 100' long. The box contains copper nails and the cask is three quarters full of hard, dry tar.\n\n6. SHIP'S GALLEY\n\nYou have obviously entered the galley. There is a crude metal stove (unlit) against the hull beneath the porthole. It has an adjustable metal chimney that can be placed through the porthole when this is opened. Beside the stove is an open metal bin containing sticks of wood kindling, and beside this is a large wood table, bolted firmly to the deck with a thick top criss-crossed with score marks. The table has a large drawer.\n\nHanging from hooks set into the hull above the table are two iron frying pans, two saucepans and a skillet. Set against the bulkhead opposite is a large cask that seems to be full of a clear liquid. Beside this stands a wooden cupboard. Against the bulkhead beside the forward door is a wooden upright chair, while hanging from the centre of the deck above is an unlit, hooded lantern.\n\nAgain there is nothing of significant value and the area is unoccupied. The drawer, which is unlocked, holds an assortment of butcher's knives, saws and choppers. The cask contains water while the cupboard contains a miscellany of tin mugs, small and large tin plates, wooden platters and a metal dipper.\n\n7. LIZARD MEN'S QUARTERS\n\nThere is a distinct odour about this room that reminds you of a marsh or swamp - not fetid, not oppressive, but certainly noticeable.\n\nIn the centre of the area is a wood table, bolted to the deck. On the table is a silver jug half full of a red liquid; with it are three pewter mugs. Round the table are set three wooden, upright chairs while an unlit, hooded lantern hangs from the deck above.\n\nIn the gloom you can see that there are three hammocks - one at each end of the cabin (slung between the bulkhead and one of the ship's ribs), the third across the corner of the cabin from next to the aft door to the central bulkhead. Each hammock appears to be 'occupied'.\n\nA small chest or box of some sort is lying under the most forward hammock. There appear to be weapons under each of the hammocks.\n\nThe silver jug on the table contains wine and is worth 100 gp but the pewter mugs are of no value. A lizard man is asleep in each hammock. If there has been little or no noise on the main deck and adjacent rooms, and if the party enters quietly, the lizard men will not be aroused (but the pseudo-dragon will alert one of them - see below).\n\nUnder the hammocks are arms and armour: \n\nLarge shield and broadsword - under hammock by aft door (lizard man no. 2)\nThree javelins - under hammock in corner (lizard man no.3)\nLarge shield and broadsword - under forward hammock (lizard man no. 1)\n\nThere is also a chest - wooden with iron bands - under the third hammock. The chest is locked and the lock is trapped with a poisoned needle (Scorpion Venom; DC 18; Initial Damage 1d6 Strength; Secondary Damage 1d6 Strength). The chest contains 1,000 ep (this is the second part-payment for the consignment of weapons, to be handed over on completion of delivery). The key to the chest is fastened to the inside of the shield under the same hammock.\n\nLying in a small, special nest in the corner behind the chest is a pseudo-dragon. This is the companion and pet of lizard man no. 1. Because of the chameleon-like powers of this creature, it is 80% undetectable to characters unable to see invisible objects (though it can see invisible objects and persons itself). Due to the presence of this little creature, it will be impossible for anyone to enter this area unnoticed, and as long as its companion lizard man is alive it will fight to defend him and his treasure from all his enemies. Once the lizard man is dead the pseudo-dragon will only fight if attacked first and only for as long as an attack is sustained on it.\n\nNote that the pseudo-dragon will normally fight independently - it will not be in contact with its lizard man companion and will therefore not confer its magic resistance on him. Once lizard man no. 1 is dead, there is a basic 50% chance that the pseudo-dragon will select one human/humanoid party member as its new companion. This member must be one who has not actually attacked lizard man no. 1 or the pseudo-dragon itself, and the little creature's order of preference from among the party members will be (1) a druid (2) a ranger (3) any character of neutral good alignment (4) any character having neutral in his alignment but not evil (5) any magic-user having good in his alignment.\n\nWhere there is parity among party members as regards the listed preferences, then these will be cumulative in effect. For example, the pseudo-dragon will give preference to a neutral good magic-user over a neutral good cleric. Where two or more party members have equally valid claims to preference then the Dungeon Master must decide the issue. There will only be one chance for the entire party and not one for each eligible party member. Should there be no eligible party member present, or should the percentage die roll be a failure, then the pseudo-dragon will seek to escape by flying away at the earliest opportunity. If the charisma score of the individual concerned is 15 or above it enhances the basic 50% chance by a further 5% for each point of charisma over 14. Non-player characters are not eligible for selection by the pseudo-dragon.\n\nNote: the DM may query how long it takes the pseudo-dragon to awaken and alert its lizard man companion, assuming the latter is not alerted by the party's entry. It will communicate the warning rapidly - in one segment - and the warning will appear as a dream to the lizard man. However, it will take him the rest of that round to waken and become aware of the actuality. At the end of one round he will be fully awake and alert (though not, of course, carrying his sword and shield).\n\nNote on Melee: this room has dimensions of 10' x 10' and contains three lizard men, three hammocks, a chest, a table and chairs. It will also, in the event of melee, contain some party members. Melee with weapons longer than 3' will normally be impossible and the DM should enforce this strictly. If a character insists on using a weapon that would, in the circumstances, be virtually impossible to wield properly, penalise that character's 'to hit' roll severely. The lizard men will not even attempt to use their javelins, broadswords or shields, instead relying on teeth and claws.\n\nLizard man no. 1 (sleeping in the hammock furthest from the main deck) is obviously the leader of this group. He wears a silver collar around his neck, value 5 gp; on it is a crudely engraved emblem of a lizard with forked tongue extended (cf. the pictoglyph on the document in the captain's cabin and the large shield in area 15).\n\nLIZARDFOLK, Medium-sized Humanoid (Aquatic, Reptilian)\n\nHit Dice\t2d8+2 (11 hit points)\nInitiative\t+0\nSpeed\t30 feet\nAC\t15 (+5 natural) or 17 (+5 natural, +2 large shield)\nAttacks\t2 Claws +2 melee or Broadsword +2 melee\n\tBite +0 melee or javelin +1 ranged\nDamage\tClaw 1d4+1, Broadsword 1d8+1\n\tBite 1d4, Javelin 1d6+1\nSaves\tFort +1, Ref +3, Will +0\nAbilities\tStr 13, Dex 10, Con 13, Int 9, Wis 10, Cha 10\nSkills\tBalance +4, Jump +7, Swim +9\nFeats\tMultiattack\n\nPSEUDODRAGON, Tiny Dragon\n\nHit Dice\t2d12+2 (15 hit points)\nInitiative\t+0\nSpeed\t15 feet, Fly 60 feet (good)\nAC\t18 (+2 size, +6 natural)\nAttacks\tSting +4 melee, Bite -1 melee\nDamage\tSting 1d3 and poison, Bite 1\nSpecial Attacks\tPoison sting\nSpecial Qualities\tSee invisibility, telepathy, immunities, SR 19\nSaves\tFort +4, Ref +0, Will +0\nAbilities\tStr 11, Dex 11, Con 13, Int 10, Wis 12, Cha 10\nSkills\tHide +8 (+16 in overgrown areas), Intuit Direction +3, Listen +5, Search +2, Spot +5 \nFeats\tAlertness\nNotes\tPoison: Fortitude save (DC 12); Initial damage sleep 1 minute; Secondary damage sleep 1d3 days. \n\tSee invisibility: Pseudodragons continuously see invisibility as the spell, 60 feet range. \n\tTelepathy: Pseudodragons can communicate telepathically with creatures that speak Common or Sylvan, range 60 feet. \n\tImmunities: Pseudodragons are immune to sleep and paralysis effects.\n\n8. PUNKETAH'S QUARTERS\n\nThis seems to be one of the 'master' cabins. The furnishings and fittings are of good quality and the place is clean and tidy.\n\nA single bunk, made-up with bed linen, has its head against the bulkhead running along the centre-line of the ship next to what appears to be a wooden partition squaring off the corner near the main deck.\n\nIn the centre of the room is a polished wood table, apparently bolted to the deck. On the table is a silver bowl containing an assortment of fruit, a silver carafe half full of a light red liquid and a silver goblet. Against the table are set two upright, wooden chairs and a padded, leather chair.\n\nOn the deck under the porthole in the stern is a wooden, brass bound chest. Beside it is a pair of highly polished black leather boots.\n\nFrom the centre of the deck above, over the table, hangs a hooded lantern (unlit).\n\nThe cabin appears to be unoccupied.\n\nThis is the private cabin of Punketah, the wizard (See Appendix).\n\nThe values of the 'obvious' items are:\n\nSilver bowl 150 gp\nSilver carafe 150 gp\nSilver goblet 100 gp\n\nThe carafe contains a pleasant wine, very mild in its effects. On a peg behind the door hangs a robe, maroon in colour but of no particular value. The chest is locked and trapped (Cloud of Ungol Dust. Fortitude save (DC 15); Initial damage 1 Charisma; Secondary damage 1d6 Charisma + 1 point permanent Charisma). It contains various items of clothing, none of any value, and a leather purse holding 50 gp. In a secret compartment in the lid of the chest (detect as secret door) is Punketah's spell book, contents:\n\nZero level: All Cantrips\nFirst level: Expeditious Retreat, Magic Missile, Sleep, Spider climb, Tenser’s Floating Disc\nSecond level: Scare, Summon Monster II, Web\n\nOn the last page of the book there is written, in the common tongue, the word 'ABRACAPHAGIC' which is the command word for his Wand of Magic Detection. With the spell book there is also a hollow metal tube, sealed with a cap at one end, which contains a magic-user's scroll of Gust of Wind scribed at 6th level (see Player’s Handbook page 212). The left boot has a hollow swivel heel inside which is the key to the chest. Using the key to open the chest will set off the trap unless the latter is detected and disarmed.\n\nIn normal circumstances Punketah will not be in his cabin, but if events are such that the DM decides he has returned from the poop deck, he will be sitting at the table, apparently deep in thought (probably considering research of new spells). Note the secret door connecting this cabin to the captain's.\n\n9. CAPTAIN'S CABIN\n\nThis seems to be one of the 'master' cabins. The furnishing and fittings are of good quality and the place is clean, though somewhat untidy.\n\nA single bunk, made-up with bed linen, has its head against the bulkhead running along the centre-line of the ship next to what appears to be a wooden partition squaring off the corner near the main deck.\n\nA writing desk is set against the hull below the stern porthole; it has a drawer on each side and three trays on the top. Also on the desk top, just in front of the trays, there is an inkpot; two quill pens, a small knife and a pewter, pepper-pot-like container. Against the desk is set a wooden, upright chair, while beside the desk is set a wooden, brassbound chest.\n\nAgainst the hull, on the starboard side, is a padded leather couch. In front of it a bearskin rug lies on the deck while beneath the couch can be seen a fairly large metal box. An unlit hooded lantern hangs from the centre of the deck above.\n\nThe cabin appears to be unoccupied.\n\nOf the trays on the desktop next to the pepper-pot container (which is nearly full of fine sand), one is empty, another pertains bills and receipts for various items of marine supply. The last contains several letters of a personal and alarmingly intimate nature from three different ladies in three different ports (each of whom is under the common misapprehension that she is Mrs. Sigurd 'Snake Eyes') and a curious, semi-literate document requesting a further supply of ironware \"as per previous consignments and at the agreed terms.\" The signature here is in the form of a pictoglyph and shows a lizard with forked tongue extended. The last item is of course a request from the lizard men for further weapons to be supplied. The DM must exercise caution here in not making the document too explicit - the lizard men would not want the document to fall into the wrong hands and will have concealed as much of the real meaning of the request as possible consistent with making the request clear to the Captain. Use words like 'goods' - on no account 'weapons'.\n\nThe two desk drawers are locked and the key for them is in Sigurd's belt pouch. The first drawer contains four small, crystal phials containing potions: two of Cure Light Wounds, one of Cure Disease and one of Neutralise Poison. These are labelled in the common tongue. The drawer also contains four dirty glass tumblers, a half empty bottle of brandy and the key that unlocks the chains holding the Aquatic Elf prisoner (see room 14).\n\nThe second drawer contains a number of charts of various sea and coastal localities, all obviously prepared by professional cartographers, but behind these there is a last and crudely drawn chart (see the Appendix). This chart indicates that the rendezvous point with the lizard men is at a small promontory beside a river in the tidal marshes, 10 miles south south west of the town of Saltmarsh. The bearskin rug covers the hatch in the floor that provides access to area 13.\n\nA grey cloak (no special properties) hangs on a peg on the back of the door. The wooden chest beside the desk is unlocked and untrapped. It contains items of clothing including a well-worn but comfortable pair of carpet slippers.\n\nThe iron box under the couch is trapped - scything blade for 1-6 hit points of damage. The key is in Sigurd's belt pouch, but opening the box with the key will set off the trap unless the latter is detected and disarmed. The box contains 1,000 ep - the first half of the payment from the lizard men for the weapons.\n\nNote the possibilities afforded by the secret door to cabin 8.\n\n10. CREW'S QUARTERS\n\nVarious unpleasant odours of human occupation compete for recognition here, stale perspiration emerging as (just) dominant. This is obviously the crew's quarters and appears to fill the entire forward part of this deck.\n\nThere is a companionway staircase leading upwards from a point about 6' from the bulkhead. Near it, more to starboard, is a door.\n\nAround the perimeter of the cabin, slung between hooks on the bulkhead and on supporting poles, are eight hammocks. To judge from the slack way in which they hang, the hammocks appear to be unoccupied at present. Beneath each hammock is a brassbound wooden sea chest - most are closed but two have open lids, and appear to contain clothes.\n\nIn the centre of the cabin is a long plain wooden table with a bench along each of its long sides. These items appear to be bolted to the deck. The table is stained and dirty and has an untidy pile of dirty tin plates and cups roughly stacked in a large tin bucket below it. Over the table, hanging from the deck above, is an unlit hooded lantern.\n\nAgainst the starboard side, adjoining the porthole is an area that appears to have been closed off by cheap, dirty cloth hangings extending from ceiling to floor.\n\nThe cabin appears to be unoccupied at present. It is smelly, dirty and untidy and most unpleasant to be in.\n\nThere is nothing of value and little of interest here. The curtained area contains two large tin buckets standing side by side on the floor. Both are empty but they are stained and dirty and emit a foul smell. Perhaps this section should be given no further explanation....\n\nThe sea chests all contain clothes and other personal effects. The garments are all stained, grubby and in poor condition. Of minor interest among the remaining items to be found are the following (the chests are not numbered in any particular order):\n\nIn chest 1: \ta pack of well-used, greasy playing cards (examination will reveal two identical aces of spades).\nIn chest 5: \ttwo sets of dice, one set being 'loaded’.\nIn chest 7: \ta book of addresses and names of ladies in various parts of the local area. A number of these have brief comments by them concerning the 'merits' of the ladies in question.\n\n11. CARGO HOLD\n\nThere is some source of light in here that shows that this is a cargo hold. Through the centre runs a section of the main mast; beside it, narrow wooden stairs lead up to the hatch above. Against the aft bulkhead are stacked bolts of cloth, lashed by ropes to brackets bolted to the deck so they are secure. On each side there are stacked a large number of small casks, again secured by ropes to the deck. In places the walking-space between stacks of merchandise is restricted, but the place is obviously well organised.\n\nThe light source is a lantern hanging from the deck above just forward of the main mast. The bolts are of silk; there are 90 of them, each 3' long by 1' diameter and each worth 100 gp. The casks are each 1' 6\" high by 1 ' diameter; there are 304 casks in total, of which 81 contain brandy, 219 fine wine, three scented soaps and one salt. These casks are worth 50 gp, 10 gp, 75 gp and 15 gp each respectively. All this contraband is securely stowed.\n\n(Note that, though the total value of the contraband is 15,480 gp, a 25% excise duty will be levied on this merchandise by the people of Saltmarsh, making the haul worth 11,610 gp to the party.)\n\nThe map of the hold shows barrel shapes that are intended to illustrate the area of deck taken up by these casks. They do not represent the actual sizes of the casks. Unless the alarm has been raised on deck, there will be four smugglers in the hold when the party arrives (See the Appendix for full statistics). Leaning on the stack of casks immediately to port of the main mast, clutching some documents is the ship's Bosun -'Foul' Frithoff. Near him, aft of the main mast and talking raucously to each other about their female 'conquests' are smugglers nos. 2 and 3. Just inside the forward door, apparently counting the casks on the starboard side is smuggler no. 7.\n\nNote what has been said in the section FEATURES OF THE SMUGGLERS' SHIP about the combustibility of some of the contraband. The party must be careful in this area if naked flames are employed for any reason. Note also that the party will probably see the hatch covering the access to the bilge. Forward of the mast is a plain wooden hatch cover.\n\n12. BOSUN'S CABIN\n\nThis cabin appears to fill half the stern section of this deck, with one bulkhead running along the centre line of the ship. Along this bulkhead, leading upwards and forward, is an enclosed companion way. At its foot, a door in the central bulkhead seems to lead to the other half of the stern section.\n\nIn the centre of the cabin there is a plain wood table on which stand a pewter flagon and a pewter mug. Beside the table is a wooden chair and over the table, hanging from the deck above, is an unlit hooded lantern. Also hanging from the deck above, at the aft end of the cabin, is a large cage in which there is a parrot, apparently asleep. Next to the porthole hangs a hammock, apparently unoccupied. Beneath it is a brassbound, wooden sea chest.\n\nThe cabin appears to be unoccupied (except for the parrot).\n\nThe sea chest is neither locked nor trapped. It contains only some garments -- grubby and of no value. Concealed by the garments is a locked (but not trapped) iron box that contains 200 sp, a spear, a dagger and a crossbow (the Aquatic Elf's weapons). The crossbow is damaged beyond repair. The key is in the bosun's belt pouch. The flagon is almost full of rough cider - a strong brew that is classified as a strong intoxicant.\n\nWhen anyone enters the cabin, the parrot will immediately wake, squawk, say \"Pieces of Eight - Pieces of Eight\", squawk again and then go back to sleep. Its cries will in no way alert or alarm the smugglers - they are accustomed to it and most regard it as a nuisance.\n\nNote the secret door to area 14. It is possible that the prisoner in that area (see below) will hear the party in the Bosun's cabin. Whether he shouts to try to attract their attention in these circumstances depends a great deal on what he hears, and the DM must judge according to the circumstances. As guidelines, amongst the things he might overhear which would encourage him to shout are:\n\nGenerally, matters consistent with his Neutral Good alignment;\nAn Elven voice;\nThe Elven tongue;\nA clear indication that the party is anxious to put a stop to the smuggler's activities.\n\nSome of the things that would discourage him are:\n\nGenerally, anything contrary to the basic precepts of his Neutral Good alignment;\nAnything apparently hostile to the Elven race or to non-humans in general;\nTalk of murder or other violent brutality;\nAnything apparently hostile to aquatic creatures.\n\nHowever, it should be noted that the prisoner speaks and understands the elvish tongue only.\n\n13. MATE'S CABIN\n\nThis cabin appears to occupy half the stern section of this deck, with one bulkhead running along the centre line of the ship. Along this bulkhead, leading upwards in the direction of the bow, is an enclosed companion way. At its foot a door in the central bulkhead seems to lead to the other part of the stern section. On a peg on this door hangs a dark blue cloak.\n\nA single bunk, the bed linen heaped in an untidy pile, is set against the hull under the porthole. At its foot is a brassbound wooden sea chest, its lid closed. Under the bunk is a brass box, also closed.\n\nIn the centre of the cabin is a plain wooden table apparently bolted to the deck. On it are two books, one open and propped up against the other. Beside the table is a wooden chair. Hanging from the centre of the deck above, over the table, is an unlit, hooded lantern.\n\nJust aft of the hook that carries the lantern is an obvious hatch, 3' square.\n\nThe cabin appears to be unoccupied.\n\nThe sea chest is neither locked nor trapped and contains some garments and a pair of boots - mostly quite old but reasonably clean. The brass box under the bed is locked but not trapped. The key is in the Mate's belt pouch. The box contains 500 sp. The books on the table are:\n\nPrinciples of Navigation by Da Korma (open) and\nLegal Distinctions in Letters of Marque by Tazaar (closed).\n\nEach book can be sold for 10 gp in any port or fishing town/village - it will be simple to find a purchaser in Saltmarsh. The cloak has no special properties and no significant value.\n\n14. SECRET PRISON CELL\n\nA small, dark, oppressively cramped area only 4' wide at the most, squeezed in between the ship's stern and the adjacent cabin, this appears to be used as a cell, for there is a slim, human-like figure cowering in the far corner. The prisoner appears to be chained to the hull.\n\nThe figure is that of an Aquatic Elf who is chained to the hull; the key to unlock his chains is the one in the Captain's writing desk drawer. If the characters demonstrate friendship and release him, this Elf will have an interesting story to relate and will, furthermore, assist the party to the best of his ability in their undertaking. However, he speaks and understands only the elvish tongue, and the following must be kept from the party unless/until communication is possible.\n\nHis name is Oceanus and he is a member of the tribe of Manaan who inhabit the coastal waters about 15 miles southwest of Saltmarsh. He was stripped of his weapons and armour when imprisoned, but though bruised and hungry, he has suffered no great injury and his spirit is undaunted. His tribe has noted, from a distance, the periodic arrival of the Sea Ghost at night at a supposedly deserted, coastal area. Suspicious of this mysterious behaviour, the tribal chief detailed Oceanus to follow the ship back to her port of origin and to discover what he could of these strange proceedings. This Oceanus did, and at the vessel's home port witnessed the purchase and stowing aboard of a large amount of weaponry. The same night, Oceanus slipped aboard the ship to investigate things further, but he was no sooner on deck than he was surprised and stunned, to awaken some time later chained to this very spot.\n\nHe is uncertain as to how long he has been a prisoner or what his ultimate fate would have been, but if asked he will surmise about 48 hours for the former and unpleasant for the latter. He has no knowledge of the lizard men aboard (he has not seen them) nor does he or any member of his tribe know of the colony of lizard men for whom the arms are intended, as this colony is a new one only recently reoccupied and the lizard men there have taken pains to ensure that their presence is unnoticed by any of the local inhabitants.\n\nDuring his imprisonment he has been brought rather unpleasant food three times and a cup of brackish, stale water about six times. On each occasion the bearer has been a large bully of a person with a hook instead of a left hand (the Bosun, though Oceanus does not know this) accompanied by another member of the ship's crew (actually smuggler no. 7) who has done nothing but hover uncertainly in the background. These visitations apart, he has been left to his own devices. If invited to do so, he will join the party with enthusiasm and will stay with them throughout their remaining adventures, only then - and reluctantly - leaving them to return home, for he has been fired with the spirit of adventure. Indeed he will, if requested to do so, remain with the party for the adventures in modules U2 and U3, in which circumstances the DM should ask one of the players to 'run' Oceanus for the rest of the adventure(s). At all times he will be as co-operative and as helpful as possible, playing a full role in the party's undertakings (he will, of course, expect a normal proportion of treasure).\n\nOCEANUS - Aquatic Elf, 3rd level fighter, 2nd level rogue\n\nHit Dice\t3d10+2d6+5 (33 hit points)\nInitiative\t+7 (+3 Dex, +4 Improved Initiative)\nSpeed\t30 feet, Swim 40 feet\nAC\t13 (+3 Dex) or 17 (+3 Dex, +4 Chain Shirt)\nAttacks\tTrident +6 melee, Light Crossbow +7 ranged\nDamage\tTrident 1d8+3, Light Crossbow 1d8\nSaves\tFort +4, Ref +7, Will +2\nAbilities\tStr 14, Dex 17, Con 13, Int 13, Wis 12, Cha 15\nSkills\tClimb +5, Craft (carving) +3, Handle Animal +5, Hide +8, Listen +6, \n\tMove Silently +8, Spot +4, Swim +11\nFeats\tImproved Initiative, Exotic Weapon Proficiency (underwater crossbow), \n\tWeapon Focus (Trident), Weapon Specialisation (Trident)\nRogue abilities\tSneak Attack +1d6, Evasion\nNotes\tGills: Aquatic elves can survive out of water for 1 hour per point of Constitution.

THE SECRET CACHE\n\nThis cramped area, only 4' wide at the widest, is sandwiched between the adjacent cabin and the ship's stern. It contains a number of large, irregularly shaped bundles, wrapped in oilskins and bound with light rope. These are piled apparently at random on the deck, as though thrown in casually from the door.\n\nThis is the place in which the weapons are housed during their journey to the customers (the lizard men). There are eight bundles here at the moment:\n\n1: \tContains ten morning stars\n2: \tContains ten broad swords\n3: \tContains eight small shields\n4: \tContains 20 javelins\n5: \tContains 20 javelins\n6: \tContains ten broad swords\n7: \tContains ten morning stars\n8: \tContains four small shields and a large shield; this latter is emblazoned on the front with the design of a lizard, with forked tongue extended.\n\nThere is no identification of any sort on any of the bundles, nor is there anything else in this area.\n\n16. THE BILGE\n\nFrom the hatchway you can see a little in the gloom below. The area seems to stretch the full width of the ship and, for all you can see, the full length, for no bulkheads are in view. What must be the bottom of the ship is covered with a thick layer of wet sand (presumably the ballast) on top of which is an inch or so of greenish, greasy water. A scuttling noise towards the stern indicates there is some life here - perhaps living off the garbage thrown in occasionally by lazy crew, for there are heaps of garbage near the area immediately below the hatch, which have formed small 'islands' in the 'sea,' a particularly large one having formed at the base of the main mast. As you move your light source back and forward, you catch a yellowish reflection some 15' forward and to port of your position, in one of the garbage piles.\n\nA number of rats eke out a precarious existence here, but they are of the normal variety and harmless.\nThe yellowish glint comes from two gold pieces partially embedded in a garbage 'island'. However, this particular islet also contains six rot grubs that will attack any character incautious enough to rummage through the garbage. Simply picking out the two exposed coins will not render the character vulnerable. Note that there is only 2' headroom in the bilge. There is nothing else of interest or value in this area.\n\nROT GRUB, Tiny vermin\n\nHit Dice\t1 hit point\nInitiative\t+1 (Dex)\nSpeed\t20 feet\nAC\t13 (+2 size, +1 Dex)\nAttacks\tTouch +0 melee\nDamage\tBurrow\nSpecial Qualities\tBurrow\nSaves\tFort +0, Ref +1, Will +0\nAbilities\tStr 2, Dex 13, Con 10, Int -, Wis 10, Cha 1\nSkills\tJump +5, Hide +5\nNotes\tBurrow: A rot grub leaps onto its intended prey and quickly burrows beneath the skin. It then travels through the flesh towards the prey’s vital organs (brain, heart, etc.), killing the target in 1d4+3 rounds. Each additional grub on the target reduces this time by 1 round (minimum of 2 rounds). A rot grub can be plucked from the target immediately after its initial attack (normal to hit roll required), or it can be burnt from the target’s flesh, causing standard fire damage to the target. A Cure Disease spell instantly kills all rot grubs infesting a target.\n\n17. CROW'S NEST\n\nThis is not shown on the main plans, but is - predictably enough - high up the mast, 40' above the main deck. Access to it is achieved by the rope ladder whose foot is by the hatch on the main deck. It is an all-wood open platform, 10' square with wooden 'walls' 3' high and having a 2' square hatch which lets onto the rope ladder that in turn descends to the main deck. \n\nThe single occupant of this dangerous area at the start of the adventure (when the 'invading party' first approaches the ship) is smuggler no. 8. He, like his colleagues on the deck below, is looking towards the Haunted House and awaiting a signal. There is no chance that he will detect the party's approach to, or boarding of the ship if his colleagues below fail to do so - his gaze is fixed at a higher level. If those on the deck below detect the party's intrusion, h is attention will be attracted (even if his colleagues forget to alert him) and he will descend with all speed to the deck to assist his mates. Otherwise he will be oblivious to the party's intrusion unless and until someone climbs the rope ladder or the rigging towards his position; he will always detect such an approach when the climber is 11'16' below him, and will investigate - attacking if circumstances demand it with his short bow. Attacks made from outside the crow's nest on characters inside it are made at -3 'to hit' in addition to any other penalties that may also be in effect. This reflects the defensive bonus the 3' high walls of the crow's nest impart to any occupants.\n\nTREASURE FROM THE SEA GHOST\n\nNote what has been said in the DM's descriptive section relating to area 11 about the value of the contraband and how much the party can expect to realise for it. With that exception, all treasure may be collected in full by the party members - the Saltmarsh authorities will gladly give the reward in addition. The prize money value of the Sea Ghost herself (assuming she is not damaged) is 5,000 gp. There will be no excise duty levied on this amount.\n\nThe two fishermen (should they survive) should be given equal shares of all treasure collected, the calculation for them being the same as for any other member of the party (they cannot make any claim for magical items of any kind, however). Should one be slain in the course of the adventure, his surviving colleague will claim the deceased man's share on behalf of the bereaved dependents, and it may be a test of alignment within the party as to whether this claim is allowed. If both are killed, it will be for the party (failing them, the Town Council) to make the claim on behalf of both sets of dependents; the Council members will fight (orally only, of course) for this and again this could prove a test of the alignment of party members.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nThat completes the description of the SEA GHOST adventure. If the party has successfully completed its mission, the seagoing side of the smuggling operation will have been rendered inoperative, and in addition the party will have gained some or all of the following information:\n\n1.\tIn addition to smuggling contraband of the more conventional sort, the smugglers are running weapons to a colony of lizard men, for reasons which are at present obscure;\n\n2.\tThe location of the lizard men's colony; and the fact that this weapon smuggling appears to have been going on for some months;\n\n3.\tIf they have enough information, the party should be able to deduce that the lizard men are planning either an attack on Saltmarsh (the only human habitation within miles of the lizard men's lair) or on some other place, location at present unknown.\n\nThe possibility, at least, of the former should provoke the party into warning the Saltmarsh Council (if they do not, the excise men will certainly do so if they are still alive) and this should lead directly to the adventure described in module U2, DANGER AT DUNWATER. If the party fails to gain enough information, or makes the wrong deductions (or no deductions at all) then the DM must decide whether the party should be coaxed towards the U2 adventure. If not, then adventuring in the Saltmarsh area would appear to be at an end! If the DM wishes to coax the party towards module U2 and further adventuring, this must be done craftily without 'giving the game away' too much, for a party with too much information will probably have an unsatisfactory adventure. Rather, the DM must slyly bend the conversation this way and that amongst the players until at least a vestige of the right train of thought appears.\n\nRemember that U1 is a 'thinking players module' - neither the smugglers in the Haunted House nor their colleagues aboard the Sea Ghost should present a serious challenge to a well organised, intelligent party, though deductions of the truth (or at least as much of it as is exposed here) from the scraps of evidence will pose a greater challenge, as will the formulation of the correct policy to pursue for the next stage of this series of adventures.\n\nAPPENDIX\n\nTHE PLOT (précis for the Dungeon Master)\n\nA gang of smugglers are running contraband (brandy, silk and such) on the ship Sea Ghost to a sleepy coastal area from where it can be distributed to a wider market. They have chosen an old house, locally reputed to be haunted, on the cliff near the small fishing town of Saltmarsh as their landing-point for they can obtain easy and secret access to the cellars without attracting local attention via a sea cave. To further cover their activities, they have taken steps to encourage the sinister reputation of the house and the leader of the shore-based part of the gang, being an illusionist, has used his spell powers to make the house a frightening place to visit, so the locals shun it completely. \n\nOne of the 'receivers' of the contraband is a prominent merchant in Saltmarsh. The smugglers are, additionally, running arms to a colony of lizard men for reasons that are explained in module U2, DANGER AT DUNWATER. The frequent visits of the ship have gone unnoticed by the people of Saltmarsh but they have aroused the curiosity of a tribe of Aquatic Elves nearby and a member of the tribe has been sent to investigate. Though they are too frightened to do anything themselves about the Haunted House, the people of Saltmarsh would be very grateful if its menace were removed!\n\nTHE HAUNTED HOUSE\n\nHuman Smugglers\n\nThere are eight human smugglers in total. Each smuggler carries a small amount of personal wealth about his person:\n\nNo. 1:\tLarge gold earring in right ear-lobe (15 gp); belt pouch with 3 gp, 13 sp, 7 cp, gem worth 200 gp.\nNo. 2:\tGold chain with 'lucky charm' round neck (60 gp); large gold earring (15 gp)\nNo. 3:\tPair of large gold earrings (50 gp the pair); belt pouch containing 15 sp.\nNo. 4:\tGold ring on finger (75 gp); belt pouch containing 6 sp.\nNo. 5:\tGold bracelet (75 gp) on right forearm; belt pouch containing 3 gp.\nNo. 6:\tLarge gold ear-ring (25 gp) in right ear lobe; belt pouch containing 9 sp.\nNo. 7:\t'Lucky charm' on chain around neck (60 gp); belt pouch containing 2 sp.\nNo. 8:\t'Lucky charm' on chain round neck (60 gp); no other treasure.\n\nSMUGGLERS - 1st level warriors\n\nHit Dice\t1d8 (7 hit points)\nInitiative\t+0\nSpeed\t30 feet\nAC\t12 (+2 Leather)\nAttacks\tShort sword +1 melee, Dagger +1 melee\nDamage\tShort sword 1d6, Dagger 1d4\nSaves\tFort +2, Ref +0, Will +0\nAbilities\tStr 11, Dex 10, Con 10, Int 10, Wis 10, Cha 10\nSkills \tClimb +2, Intimidate +2, Jump +2, Swim +2\n\nSanbalet's Parchment and Signalling System\n\n-\tLong flash (1-2 seconds)\n\nx\tShort flash (1/4 second approx)\n\n- x x x (line 1)\tInitial signal from ship to shore, this means roughly \"We are here with another load, is it safe?\" It is flashed three times per hour.\n\nx - x - (line 2)\tReply from shore to ship, meaning \"Everything is safe\".

Just from asking around, they learn the following general information:\nThe Keep is an old stone tower located in the hills a few miles from Talrinel, in a wilderness area where few people go.  It was built by a spell-casting member of the aristocracy, but fell into ruin long ago—legend has it, after the lord of the castle went into an unexplained rage and murdered his entire household.  It is now said to be haunted.\nThe players go to the local tavern and strike up a conversation with a grizzled old man, who says:\nAye, the Keep.   I’d not go there if I were you.  There was a bunch of people much like yourselves went up there not too long ago.  An elf, a dwarf, couple of big guys with swords, a priest of St. Cuthbert’s, and a real pretty wizard lady.  Nice people; said they had a treasure map, they did, and they was going up there to get the treasure.  Left, what was it, six days ago, wasn’t it?  Never came back.\n\nThe Dungeonmaster should be aware that the basic legend of the Keep is true, and there is indeed a treasure store in a basement level.  The Keep is now home to a Gauth (also called a Lesser Beholder, Monster Manual page 25-26, with modifications set out in the description of Room Dungeon B below) who overwhelmed and killed off the overconfident first-level adventurers who arrived there five days ago.  The PCs will find clues to the fate of those poor unfortunates as they go.\n\n\nOn the journey to the Keep\n\nAbout halfway to the Keep, the players come upon the following scene:\nYou see eight dead orcs lying along the trail in a space of about fifty feet.  To judge from the condition of the bodies, they have been here about a week.  Two of the orc bodies have arrows sticking out of them, three others are hideously burned, and the other three appear to have died from sword cuts.  Just off to the side of the trail, there is a mound of dirt that appears to be a recently-dug grave.  At one end of the mound is a marker consisting of a roughly-cut log, about three feet high, with a holy symbol of St. Cuthbert attached to it.\nWhat happened:  The party wandered into an orc ambush.  They fought well and sent the orcs running, but their cleric was killed.  They gave the cleric a decent burial before pressing on.\nSearching the bodies will reveal no treasure or usable weapons—even if the players are creepy enough to dig up the dead cleric.  A successful DC 20 Spot or Tracking check reveals evidence that a large group of orcs set an ambush here, were beaten back, and withdrew into the forest after the fight.  There may be another dead orc or two lying back in the trees off the trail.\n\n\n\nExterior of the Keep\n\nThe Keep is a large stone tower that appears to be five stories high, sitting on top of a low hill.  There appears to have been a wall around it once, long ago, but the only evidence of that is a low, irregular mound covered in vines and weeds.  The Keep itself is intact.  In the wall facing you, there is a large double door at ground level, which is partway open.  In the level above it, there is a row of arrow slits.  Above that are a row of larger windows, evenly spaced.  The fourth level has a group of three stained glass windows in the center.\nYou catch a faint smell of rotting flesh on the breeze.\nWhile the party is marching up to the front door, there is a 20% chance that they will be attacked by a random wilderness monster (see Dungeon Master‘s Guide page 95).  If they are attacked, the sounds of battle may (at the DM’s discretion) attract the two Ghouls (Monster Manual, page 118) from Room 5B upstairs, who will emerge from the Keep after two minutes (20 combat rounds) in search of fresh meat.\n\n\n\nLevel 1\n\nRoom 1A – The entrance hall to the Keep is decorated with the remains of once-fine tapestries.  At the other end of the room is a set of double iron doors, which are part-way open.  It is dark inside.\nIf the players look around, they see the outline of a hatch in the ceiling.  This hatch is a murder hole from which the defenders could drop arrows, boiling oil, and such on anyone breaking in.\n>From this point forward, the players will need a torch or lantern, or the Darkvision skill, in order to be able to see in any room that does not have a window.\n\nRoom 1B – This is a short hallway.  There are openings at either end on the left and right, and a narrow door on the opposite side of the hall.  That door is open.\n\nRoom 1C – There are racks on the walls that may have once held weapons.  There is unrecognizable trash on the floor.  There is a door in the left wall.\n\nRoom 1D – This is an old storeroom.  There are barrels and boxes strewn about.  Whatever was in them has long ago rotted away.  If the players poke around in here, they might encounter 1d6 of Rats (Monster Manual, page 278).\n\nRoom 1E – There is a table and some old chairs in the middle of this room.  There is unrecognizable trash on the floor.  There is a door in the right-hand wall.\nThis was where the castle guards sat while on duty.\n\nRoom 1F – This is an old storeroom.  There are barrels and boxes strewn about.  Whatever was in them has long ago rotted away.  If the players poke around in here, they might encounter 1d6 of Rats (Monster Manual, page 278).\n\nRoom 1G – A spiral staircase leads up and down.  If the players make a DC 10 Spot check, they notice:  There are burn marks on the wall about five or six steps up from the floor you’re on, and you see what appear to be the feet of a dead body lying on the steps near the burn marks.\nA word about the Gauth:  The most important decision, in terms of how the story develops, occurs here: do the players go up, or down?  If they go down to the Dungeon level, they will quickly encounter the Gauth in its lair.  If they go up, the Gauth will, at some point, go up behind them; and it is then up to the DM when the Gauth makes its appearance.\n\n\nLevel 2\n\nRoom 2A – In the faint light from the arrow slit on the outer wall, you can see that the body of a dwarf lies face down on the stairs about halfway between the first and second levels.  The dwarf has been burned beyond recognition, and there are scorch marks on the wall above where he lies.\nWhat happened – The party was going up the stairs, with the dwarf bringing up the rear, when the Gauth ambushed them from behind.  The Gauth hit the dwarf with its scorching ray eye ray, rolled high on the damage dice, and incinerated him.  (Poor devil.)  The rest of the party fled upstairs.\nThe dwarf’s clothing, leather armor, and equipment have been burned so badly as to be useless, except for the head of his masterwork axe.  If someone notices it, recovers it and takes it to a craftsman (or has the skills to do the work himself), it can be remade into a masterwork dwarven axe.\n\nRoom 2B – This short hallway has doors at either end, and there is one across the hall.\n\nRoom 2C – This room was once a barracks, to judge from the row of bunks on the back wall.  There are also wall racks that might have once held weapons.\n\nRoom 2D – In the middle of the floor is a hatch.  Opening the hatch allows one to look down upon Room 1A below.\n\nRoom 2E – This room has a table and several chairs, and an old brick oven against the outer wall, between the arrow slits.  There are also wall racks that might have once held weapons.\n\n\n\nLevel 3\n\nRoom 3A – The spiral staircase continues up and down.  The door to this level is closed.  DC 20 Spot (because of the darkness) to notice scorch marks along the wall, where the Gauth’s eye ray, and the wizard’s burning hands, were fired.\n\nRoom 3B – This is a large chamber with two doors along the right wall, two on the left, and one at the other end.\n\nRoom 3C – This was once a bedroom.  The furniture is deteriorated and covered in mildew.\n\nRoom 3D – This is a latrine.  There is a toilet on the left-hand wall, back in the corner.\n\nRoom 3E – This was once a bedroom.  The furniture is deteriorated and covered in mildew.\n\nRoom 3F – This was once a bedroom.  The furniture is deteriorated and covered in mildew.\n\nRoom 3G – This was once a bedroom.  The furniture is deteriorated and covered in mildew.\nThis room is occupied by a Flock of Birds (details below) who have built their nest in the ruins.  When the players open the door, the birds attack whoever is in the doorway in defense of their nest—unless it is a Druid who makes a successful DC 12 Handle Animal check.  If the player closes the door, the attack will end.  (Birds can’t work doorknobs, you know.)\nThe Flock of Birds is treated as a Bat Swarm (Monster Manual, pages 237-38), with the following changes:\nNo blindsense\nNo low-light vision\nInitiative reduced to +0\n\n\n\nLevel 4\n\nRoom 4A – The spiral staircase continues up and down.  The door to this level is closed.  On the landing is the corpse of an elf.  The elf appears to have been recently dismembered and partially eaten.\nWhat happened – The elf drew his bow and waited for the Gauth here.  He may have scored a hit, but the Gauth froze him with its gaze and finished him off with the inflict moderate wounds eye ray.   Later, the Ghouls came by and snacked on the remains.\nThe elf’s bow was broken, but his longsword and three arrows are still intact.\n\nRoom 4B – This short hallway has doors at either end, and there is one across the hall.  The remains of a very nice rug are in the middle of the floor.\n\nRoom 4C – This room was once a baby’s nursery.  The ruins of a crib are in the back corner.\n\nRoom 4D – This was once a library.  There are shelves on three walls, but the books they once held have deteriorated into piles of mold and mildew.\nDC 25 Spot check to notice an intact scroll case on one of the shelves.  It contains a scroll of cure moderate wounds.\n\nRoom 4E – This is the former master bedroom.  The stained glass on the three windows is still intact, so this room is much better preserved than the others.  There is a beautiful woven rug on the floor.  On the left side of the room are wardrobe cabinets and a padded chair.  On the right is a large four-poster bed.  The mummified corpse of a woman lies in the middle of the bed. A rusty sword protrudes from the body, and the bed clothes are stained red-black from blood.\nThe corpse is that of the lady of the house, who was killed 437 years ago when her husband went on an insane killing spree.  If the players are here after sundown, her Spectre (Monster Manual, page 232) will appear in this room.  The Spectre will not attack unless attacked, and means the characters no harm; she will, however, bar them from leaving until she has told them her tragic story, and pled with them to give her remains a decent burial so she can rest in peace.  If the players do this for her, award each 100 experience points.  If they refuse, her cries of despair haunt them until they leave the Keep, and whenever they return.\n\n\n\n\nLevel 5\n\nRoom 5A – This is the top of the spiral staircase.  The door is open.\n\nRoom 5B – This small chamber has doors out of it to the left and right.  On the far wall is a ladder leading to a roof hatch, which is closed.  The door on the right is open.  Unless already encountered when the party first arrived, two Ghouls (Monster Manual, page 118) will emerge from the open door and attack the party.\nOnce combat with the Ghouls is over (if they are here to be fought with), the players will notice:  There is a partially burned corpse of a human fighter lying against the closed door.  The fighter’s bastard sword may be recovered.\nThe players can climb up the ladder and go out on the roof if they like.  There is nothing there of significance.\n\nRoom 5C – This room once held an artist’s studio; there are ruined canvases and books scattered throughout.  In the middle of the room is the corpse of a human fighter, badly disfigured by wounds, and by the Ghouls who have been feasting on it.\nWhat happened:  Unable to go up any further, the surviving members of the party made their last stand against the Gauth here.  The wizard was badly hurt by a bite attack on the way up the steps, and had used up all her offensive spells.  One of the fighters helped her into Room 5D, where she barricaded the door before collapsing.  The fighters then fought the Gauth to the bitter end.\nA search of the room will reveal a light shield, a battleaxe, and a short bow with three arrows.  There is also an old portrait, badly deteriorated, of a beautiful woman—the one whose body lies in Room 4E below.\n\nRoom 5D – The players will have to force the door to get in here.  When they do, they find:  This room was once used as a bedroom.  In the middle of the floor is the corpse of a woman.  Her robes are saturated with dried blood.  On the stone floor next to her outstretched hand is a crude drawing, made with a bloody finger: a large circle containing an eye and a mouth, with six lines radiating from it.\nSearching the corpse will find a light crossbow and two bolts, a spell component pouch, and a blood-soaked spellbook.\nHint:  This might be the appropriate time to have the Gauth come upstairs.\n\nRoom 5E – This room contains dozens of barrels, and a stone cistern which stored rainwater.  There is a skeleton lying in the middle of the room.  One of the victims of the killing spree 437 years ago.\n\n\nDungeon Level\n\n\nDungeon A – There is an opening at the bottom of the spiral stairs. \n\nDungeon B – This is a corridor running left to right.  If the players make any noise in this corridor, including trying to force a door, and the Gauth has not yet been encountered, it will hear them and come out into the corridor with eyes blazing.\n\nDungeon C – This large room was once used as a storeroom.  If the Gauth has not been encountered elsewhere, it will be encountered here.\nThe Gauth is as described in the Monster Manual, with the following changes:\nIn the climactic battle with the party up on Level 5, the fighter with the battle axe managed to lop off a couple of eye stalks.  The Gauth therefore has only four left: \ndispel magic\ninflict moderate wounds\nexhaustion\nsleep.\nIt has not fully recovered from its wounds, so it has only 25 HP and a +2 initiative.\n\nDungeon D – This is a small prison cell with a heavy door.  If the players poke around in here, they might encounter 1d6 of Rats (Monster Manual, page 278).\n\nDungeon E – This is a small prison cell with a heavy door.  If the players poke around in here, they might encounter 1d6 of Rats (Monster Manual, page 278).\n\nDungeon F – This is a small prison cell with a heavy door.  If the players poke around in here, they might encounter 1d6 of Rats (Monster Manual, page 278).\n\nDungeon G – This door is locked, and has a CR 2 Bricks From Ceiling Trap (Dungeon Masters Guide, page 71) which is activated if the door is opened without using a special key.  DC 15 to detect the trap, DC 20 to open the door without setting it off.\nInside:  This was the castle’s treasury.  A search will reveal 248 gold pieces, jewelry and gems worth another 268 gold, and a set of immovable rods.\n\n\n\n\nChallenge ratings (for EP purposes):\n\nGauth – CR 5\n\nRats – CR 1/8th each\n\nFlock of Birds – CR 2\n\n2 Ghouls – CR 2\n\nSpectre (if you get into a fight) –  CR 7\n\nTrap – CR 2\n\n\n\n\nMap of the Dungeon level:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDUNGEON ADV_Tinderbox\n\n\n2  may/june 2001\n\nTINDERBOX\n\n\n\n3\n\nTINDERBOX\n\nTinderbox\nCaught in the Crossfire\n\nby Mike Selinker\nartwork by David Day • cartography by Craig Zipse\n\n“Tinderbox” is a D&D adventure designed for four 1st-level player characters (PCs).\nThe action moves along a strict timeline, and as the Dungeon Master (DM) you\nshould familiarize yourself with all of the events that comprise the adventure.\n\nThe module can be modified for PCs of higher level by increasing the strength\nof the main antagonist, as discussed in the “Scaling the Adventure” sidebar.\n\nAdventure Summary\nThe module pits the PCs against Zante Barbas, an arsonist who\ncavalierly attacks a mostly wooden town. The PCs must stop\nthe arsonist before he burns the settlement down around their\nears. Following a string of clues, the heroes pursue the villain\nfrom one corner of town to the next in an attempt to end his\ndestructive rampage.\n\nAdventure Background\nPowderkeg is a fortified town built as a stopover between two\nmajor cities. A community was built for travelers, who have lit-\ntle trouble securing accommodations or obtaining provisions\nfor the long journey to the larger settlements.\n\nThe town was commissioned four years ago by a powerful\nmerchant coalition operating the roads between the two cities.\nThe merchants needed a safe place to stop on the long jour-\nney overland and figured that a hastily erected town would\nenable them to charge exorbitant prices to others who passed\nthrough, creating an unbeatable merchant cartel that could fix\nprices without fear of competition.\n\nThe region’s king watched the construction of Powderkeg\nwith an untrusting eye. He deduced what the merchants were\nplotting and knew that such monopolistic control by the cartel\nwould diminish his hold over the economy of the realm. When\nthe city was completed one year after the plans were laid, the\nking used complex economic and political maneuvers to buy\nPowderkeg out from under the merchants. This infuriated the\nleaders of the merchant cartel, who wrongly assumed that a\nfew well-placed bribes in the king’s court would cow the\nmonarch into leaving them be. In the end, their compensation\nwas less than profitable. To avoid losing investment capital and\nfuture revenues, the merchants spent a year petitioning the\nking to return the ownership of their town, but as it promised\nto be enormously profitable for the ruler, they were rebuffed.\nHowever, realizing the value of having the region’s most influ-\nential commercial magnates on his side, the king did try to\nappease the merchants.\n\nUnfortunately, one merchant was not content with the king’s\noffers. Financially ruined, this renegade merchant emptied his\nlast coffer to hire a skilled arsonist, Zante Barbas, to burn\ndown the king’s acquisition in spite. Powderkeg was a prime\ntarget for Barbas’s fires, having been built entirely of wood\n(the cheapest and most readily available material at the time).\nUnfortunately for Barbas, Burgomaster Almon Capulin’s\nwatchmen detected the arsonist’s starter fire and extinguished\nit before it could cause major damage. The arsonist was soon\ncaptured and sentenced to ten years in Powderkeg’s prisons.\nSince that incident, Powderkeg has proven a worthwhile\ninvestment, filling the king’s coffers with travelers’ gold. It has\nbeen relatively free of problems and seems likely to continue\nprospering for years to come.\n\nIt will prosper, that is, assuming it survives the night. Last\nnight, two years after his arrest, Zante Barbas escaped from\nprison. Though his employer is dead, Barbas intends to com-\nplete the contract, this time with a vengeful twist. His plan not\nonly includes the razing of Powderkeg but also the death of the\nBurgomaster. He has plotted a multidirectional attack on the\ncity using its most feared enemy—fire. He will set fires to\noccupy the watchmen, then end the festivities with the assas-\nsination of Capulin and a clean escape.\n\nAlthough Burgomaster Capulin has discounted the possibil-\nity of disaster, his advisor Wintergreen knows that Powder-\nkeg requires assistance. Knowing there is no time to ask the\nking for help, he calls upon a group of adventurers who hap-\npen to be passing through the settlement. The PCs are given\nthe chance to save the city if they can solve the arsonist’s rid-\ndle and quench his murderous plot.\n\nFor the Dungeon Master\nThis adventure is divided into two parts. The first part details\nthe events surrounding Barbas’s assault on Powderkeg and his\nattempt to assassinate Burgomaster Capulin; the second part\ndescribes the town in detail. Statistics for the major NPCs can\nbe found in the “Key NPCs in Powderkeg” sidebar.\n\nd Monsters     k Non-Player Characters (NPCs)     s Objects     c Settlements     a Traps\n\n\n\n4  may/june 2001\n\nTINDERBOX\n\nThe Twisted Schemes of Zante Barbas\n“Tinderbox” follows a strict timed plotline, in which the arson-\nist will attack various points in the city. The action begins at\n5:00 p.m. as the town’s gates are closing. You should keep\ncareful track of the time passing, with 1 minute of game time\nequalling 1 minute of real time unless events or circumstances\ncall for a different schedule. The PCs will be hard-pressed to\nignore the events as they happen, as some are quite explosive.\n\nAfter two years languishing in Powderkeg’s prison (area 10),\nZante Barbas implements his elaborate scheme against the\ntown and its Burgomaster. Instead of attacking unexpectedly,\nBarbas has chosen to alert and confuse Capulin’s staff with a\ndevilish puzzle: He has left a signed message attached to the\ntorchrunner statue in the town square (area 32).\n\nZante Barbas’s note reads as follows:\n\nBarbas plans to attack Powderkeg from five “points” or\nlocations (as indicated on the DM’s map of Powderkeg). He\nbegins with the city’s inn (area 56), “the first place.” Point two,\n“the most likely place,” is the power supplies warehouse (area\n19), while point three, “the least likely place,” is the fire station\n(area 30). Point four is the water tower (area 61), “the impos-\nsible place.” Point five, “the only place left,” is the palace (area\n13). Although the clues might suggest the targets, the first line\nof the message provides the most valuable clue. If the five\npoints are joined by straight lines in order, they form a star on\nthe map of Powderkeg, as shown on the DM’s map. (The draw-\ning of the star should not be shown to the players.) If these\n“right connections” are made, Barbas can be stopped before\nhe kills Burgomaster Capulin.\n\nHowever, Barbas intends to complicate the situation. First,\nhe will not set any fires himself. When he escaped from the\nprison and guardhouse (area 10), he reached the treasury\nroom where his magic items were kept. Unbeknownst to his\nformer captors, he gained several of these, including a single\neye of charming. This item enables Barbas to charm several\nPowderkeggers to do his dirty work. Second, he plans to cause\na diversionary fire after he has the water tower (area 61)\ntorched. This diversion on the statue of the torchrunner (area\n32) is meant to deter pursuers and facilitate his entry into the\npalace (area 13). Finally, Barbas intends to break his modus\noperandi by not burning the palace but merely assassinating\nthe Burgomaster and escaping quietly. With these twists,\nBarbas feels certain of success.\n\nWintergreen, Burgomaster Capulin’s advisor, is working\nhard to oppose Barbas. Distressed by his superior’s underes-\ntimation of the arsonist, Wintergreen has taken it upon himself\nto stop Barbas before he burns Powderkeg to ashes. His only\nclue to Barbas’s intentions is the cryptic note, so he is moni-\ntoring the reception and receiving station (area 74) to find\nadventurers who might lend aid. Wintergreen intends to give\n\nScaling the Adventure\n“Tinderbox” is designed for four 1st-level PCs and contains\nfew combat-heavy encounters. PCs will need to rely more on\ntheir wits than their weapons, although the final encounter\nwith Zante Barbas could very well end in bloodshed.\n\nThe adventure is easily modified for higher-level PCs, as\nthere is but one main villain. Here are Zante Barbas’s modi-\nfied statistics at various levels. Use whichever version of\nBarbas you like, keeping in mind that Zante should be at least\n1 level higher than the highest-level PC and no more than 4\nlevels higher than the average character level.\n\nk Zante Barbas, Male Human Rog5: CR 5; Medium-Size\nHumanoid (5 ft. 10 in. tall); HD 5d6+10; hp 30; Init +4 (Dex); Spd\n30 ft.; AC 14 (+4 Dex) or 17 (+4 Dex, +3 studded leather armor);\nAtk +8 melee (1d4+3/crit 19–20, masterwork dagger with Weapon\nFocus feat); or +6 melee (1d3+3 subdual, unarmed strike); SA sneak\nattack (+3d6); SQ evasion, uncanny dodge (Dexterity bonus to\nAC); AL CE; SV Fort +3, Ref +7, Will +0; Str 16, Dex 18, Con 14,\nInt 15, Wis 9, Cha 14.\n\nNotes: Zante gets 11 skill points per level.

The vehicle,\nwhich resides in the fire station (area 30), has not been used\nin Powderkeg to date. Wintergreen expects that Barbas will be\nsurprised by the device, which is described below.\n\nThe Fire Wagon\nThis adaptation of a standard magic item is unique to\nPowderkeg. It is a 12-foot-long, 4-foot-wide open wagon pulled\nby two light warhorses. Strapped to each of the long sides are\n15-foot-long wooden ladders. On the insides of the 1-foot-high\nwagon walls supporting these ladders are two handaxes per\nside. The back short wall can be lowered to allow entry onto\nthe rear of the wagon. Built into the front wall is a driver’s\nseat, behind which are two drivers’ whips. In the center of the\nwagon’s flatbed is a braced support stand bolted to a latched\nwooden box with three fixed and braced sides. The top and\nforward panels are removable. Inside the box is a decanter of\nendless water, specially braced so that it will hold if com-\nmanded to disgorge water. It can also be removed by hand\nfrom the top; unlatching its bracings and removing it from the\nbox is a full-round action. When in the box, it points directly\nat the driver’s seat.\n\nThe decanter’s command words (“Stream,” “Fountain,” and\n“Geyser”) reflect its three functions, all of which can be turned\noff with the same command words after the decanter has been\nactivated. It spews forth fresh water unless the command word\n“Brine” is given, in which case salt water is created. (The com-\nmand word “Freshen” restores the salt water to fresh water.)\nThe decanter reacts instantly to any of these words spoken\nloudly within normal hearing distance of it.\n\nStream: The “Stream” command causes the decanter to\nemit a slow trickle of water at one-tenth gallon per round (one\ngallon per minute). This is ineffective against all but the small-\nest fires.\n\nFountain: The “Fountain” command sends forth one-half\ngallon per round (five gallons per minute) in a 5-foot-long\nstream—enough to douse starter fires or small fires that\nremain after a large blaze has been extinguished.\n\nGeyser: The “Geyser” command ejects a continuous blast\nof three gallons per round (thirty gallons per minute) in a 20-\nfoot-long jet. This setting extinguishes one 20-foot-long by 5-\nfoot-wide area per round. The geyser can be used safely only\nwhen the decanter is secured in the wagon box or when used\nby a creature standing against a wall or similar barricade. The\nholder can move forward with the decanter at full blast only if\nhe makes a successful Strength check (DC 15).\n\nA living creature struck by the geyser takes 2d4 points of\nsubdual damage and is knocked back 5 feet per round unless\na Strength check (DC 15) succeeds; against creatures of Tiny\nsize or smaller, this is treated as real (not subdual) damage, and\nthe creature is knocked back 10 feet per round unless the\nStrength check (DC 15) succeeds. Creatures of Large size or\nbigger are not harmed by the water but can be knocked back\n5 feet if their Strength check (DC 15) fails. The geyser cannot\ndo structural damage.\n\nCreatures (EL —): The horses that pull the fire wagon are\nwell-trained. Stanch and Blaze do not bolt at the sight or scent\nof fire, although they are skittish near large conflagrations.\nd Blaze and Stanch, Light Warhorses (2): hp 22 each; see\n\nMonster Manual 197 for complete statistics.\n\nAdventure Timeline\nThe following timeline details the major actions of the NPCs,\nwhich could be altered by the intervention of the PCs. All times\nare approximate and can be adjusted for dramatic effect, at\nyour discretion. It is entirely possible for the PCs to stumble\nupon Zante Barbas, but he will always try to escape rather\nthan stand and fight. In the interest of keeping time, you might\nwant to keep a stopwatch handy.\nm 5:00 P.M. The PCs gather in the registration and receiv-\n\ning station (area 74) with Wintergreen. Zante Barbas charms\nthe elderly woman at the inn (area 56) and gives her a 2-HD\nmissile from his necklace of missiles with instructions to destroy\nthe inn. The front gates close as the sun sets.\nm 5:10 P.M. Wintergreen takes the PCs toward the fire sta-\n\ntion (area 30).\nm 5:20 P.M. The elderly woman sets the inn on fire. Jonathan\n\nand Joshua rush the fire wagon toward the inn, allowing the PCs\nto board. Wintergreen remains at the fire station for a few min-\nutes, then returns to the palace (area 13).\nm 5:30 P.M. Barbas charms the stockmaster at his residence\n\n(area 51).\nm 5:45 P.M. Barbas and the stockmaster go to the power\n\nsupplies warehouse (area 19), where Barbas takes two-wheeled\ncasks of oil to the alley across the street.\nm 6:00 P.M. As per Barbas’s instructions, the stockmaster\n\ncauses an explosion at the power supplies warehouse that can\nbe heard at the inn. The stockmaster climbs to the roof and\nbegins laughing maniacally to call attention to himself.\nm 6:10 P.M. Infirmary workers arrive at the power supplies\n\nwarehouse. Barbas enters the fire station (assuming that it is\nempty) and places both casks of oil in the rear of the main\nroom. He covers them in oil-soaked rags and places them in\nline of sight with the doorway.\n\n5\n\nTINDERBOX\n\nDangers of Firefighting\nFirefighting is a hazardous task, and it is quickly evident to\nthe PCs that Powderkeg needs professional firefighters. The\ndangers of fire are described here.\n\nCharacters stepping into or through a fire take 2d6 points\nof damage; this damage can be reduced or negated by pro-\ntective spells such as endure elements or resist elements.\nRules for catching on fire are given on page 86 of the\nDUNGEON MASTER’s Guide.\n\nCharacters within 5 feet of a raging fire or maneuvering\nthrough a burning building take 1d6 points of damage per\nminute (no save). In addition, a character must succeed at a\nFortitude saving throw every 5 minutes (DC 15, +1 per pre-\nvious check) or sustain 1d4 points of subdual damage. Those\nwearing heavy clothing or any sort of armor suffer a –4\npenalty to their saving throws. In addition, those wearing\nmetal armor or coming into contact with very hot metal are\naffected as if by a heat metal spell (see the Player’s Handbook,\npage 213, for a description of this spell).\n\nWhen acting near a fire, successful Reflex saving throws\nmight be required to perform special actions and avoid\npotentially calamitous outcomes. Actions like avoiding a\nfalling rafter or jumping on a moving fire wagon generally\nrequire a successful Reflex saving throw (DC 10). Remember\nthat these saves are modified by armor check penalties.\n\n\n\nm 6:15 P.M. Barbas ambushes two watchmen near the\nlibrary (area 29), subduing them both. He picks the lock on the\nlibrary and drags the watchmen inside. He charms one and ties\nup the other after stealing his armor, tunic, and weapons.\nm 6:30 P.M. The charmed watchman prepares a flaming\n\narrow and walks into the fire station. (If the door has been\nclosed by the PCs, he knocks first.) He fires the lit arrow at the\ncasks, which ignite immediately and explode 2 rounds later.\nm 6:45 P.M. Barbas charms the stableboy at the caravan-\n\nserai (area 60) and gives him a flask of oil with instructions  to\nburn the water tower (area 61).\nm 7:00 P.M. The stableboy climbs the water tower ladder\n\nand tries to set the roof on fire. He errs, and the flask\nexplodes near him. After a muffled bang, the boy falls to the\nground and drops to –5 hit points. He stabilizes at –9 hit points.\nInfirmary workers arrive to save him 5 minutes after the blast.\nThe water tower roof does not catch fire.\nm 7:20 P.M. Barbas dons the watchman’s uniform and walks\n\ndown Billian Street to the alley near the town square (area 32).\nm 7:45 P.M. Barbas throws a 2-HD missile from his neck-\n\nlace of missiles at the statue in the town square, destroying the\nstatue. The watchmen at the palace doors rush to the statue\narea but do not find the arsonist.\nm 8:00 P.M. With the guards distracted, Barbas walks\n\nthrough the front doors of the palace. He passes Wintergreen\nin the hall, climbs the stairs, and sneak attacks one of Capulin’s\nguards, dropping him to –5 hit points. On the next round,\nBarbas wins initiative and stabs the second guard, dropping\nhim to 2 hit points and finishing him off the following round.\nBarbas then sneaks into the Burgomaster’s room. Awakened by\nsounds of trouble in the city, the Burgomaster is able to fend\noff his attacker for 2 rounds before Barbas finally kills him with\nhis dagger. \n\nTimed Events\nThe following events are keyed to particular locations of the\nDM’s map. These events are summarized in the above timeline.\n\n5:00 P.M. Registration and Receiving Station (Area 74). The\nadventure begins when the PCs arrive at the registration and\nreceiving station just beyond the open city gates.\n\nTwo town watchmen stand at the point marked A on the\nRegistration and Receiving Area map. The watchmen steer all\nvisitors to the registration desk (marked B on the map), where\na short line of merchants and travelers register inside an open\ndoorway. Around the station, signs abound with the theme of\n“Arson is a municipal crime.” A friendly clerk, Myrtle\nHursinghar, asks all visitors to state their names and describe\nthe nature of their business, all of which she enters into a\nheavy ledger. When she sees the PCs, she calls Wintergreen,\nwho sits inside at the point marked C on the map.\n\nWintergreen emerges from behind the desk to talk with the\nPCs. After saying hello, he suggests they accompany him to\nthe town square (area 32). While walking down Arbuscle\nStreet, he explains the current situation and hands the PCs a\nmap of the town; give the players the Players’ Map of\nPowderkeg at this time.\n\nIf the PCs refuse to listen to Wintergreen, the adventure is\nover, although the PCs could become involved once Barbas’s\nplans are set into motion. Read or paraphrase the following\ntext if the PCs listen to Wintergreen:\n\nAt this point, the PCs should be in the town square. Give\nthe players a copy of Zante Barbas’s note and allow them a\nfew minutes to puzzle over it before Wintergreen resumes:\n\nIf any of the PCs refuse to help, Wintergreen asks them if\nthey understand the gravity of the situation: that the town will\nbe burned to cinders if Barbas is not stopped. PCs who decline\nto help after this can leave but can re-enter play at any time.\nIf the PCs agree, Wintergreen continues:\n\nAt this point, a loud explosion and a flash of light comes\nfrom the south, assuming the PCs are by the fire station. The\ninn is ablaze. Joshua and Jonathan, the two boys assigned by\nthe city to mind the fire station, hear the explosion and open\nthe fire station doors. The boys leap onto the wagon and guide\n\n6  may/june 2001\n\nTINDERBOX\n\n“My friends, Powderkeg is threatened with disaster. As you\ncan see, the town’s wooden construction makes the repair\nand replacement of buildings an easy task. However, the dis-\nadvantage is its vulnerability to fire. One large, uncontrolled\nblaze could reduce the community to ashes. Thankfully, we\nhave faced that possibility only once since Powderkeg first\nopened its gates three years ago. Two years past, the town\nwas nearly burned to its foundations by an arsonist named\nZante Barbas. The arsonist was hired by a member of the\nmerchant coalition that built Powderkeg. When the king\nforced the merchants to sell the town to him, many of them\nwent out of business. This particular merchant hired Barbas\nto destroy Powderkeg as revenge for the king’s deed. The\nmerchant died shortly after Barbas was captured, and the\narsonist has been confined to a prison cell ever since.\n\n“I called you out of the crowd because Barbas escaped\nlast night, injuring two watchmen in the process. I learned\nabout his escape early this morning and warned\nBurgomaster Capulin. He assumed that Barbas had fled the\ntown, but he was wrong. At about midday, the statue of the\nfamous torchrunner who blazed the trail to Powderkeg\ngained a new ornament. This note was found tied to the run-\nner’s torch. So far we have not deciphered it. Can you make\nsense of it?”\n\n“I hope that you can solve the conundrum. Zante Barbas is\nnotorious for leaving baffling clues to his crimes. He is\nuntrustworthy, so I wouldn’t place much stock in his puzzles,\nas he has been known to use them to misdirect. I don’t know\nexactly what to make of this. Perhaps adventurers of your\ncaliber can succeed where we bureaucrats have not.\n\n“But I didn’t interrupt your travels merely to solve a rid-\ndle. Shall we continue on to the fire station? I need you to\nstop Barbas before he burns down the community. Though\nour watchmen are all alert for Barbas and his fires, I need\nyou to act as firefighters for the city. A few months ago, the\ntown purchased a new magic fire wagon, but we have no\none to run it yet. I will give your group 300 gold pieces of\nthe city’s profits for insuring that Barbas cannot complete\nhis deadly work. Will you help?”\n\n“Good, and many thanks. Barbas is devious, but with your\nassistance I think our chances of getting through this are\ngood. This building here is the fire station. Now, you can rec-\nognize Barbas by—”\n\n\n\nit toward the inn. If present, Wintergreen calls out to the boys,\nwho slow the wagon and yell, “Jump on! Jump on! Fire! Fire!”\nWith or without the PCs, they rush the wagon toward the inn.\nAnyone attempting to mount the wagon while it is moving must\nsucceed at a Reflex saving throw (DC 10), as noted in the\n“Dangers of Firefighting” sidebar.\n\nCreatures (EL —): Statistics for Wintergreen, Jonathan and\nJoshua Springer, and the town watchmen are given in the\n“Key NPCs of Powderkeg” sidebar.\n\n5:20 P.M. Inn (Area 56). The inn is burning. The side facing\nArdisia Street is ablaze, and part of it has collapsed. A crowd\ngathers around the inn, though no one stands closer than 10\nyards from the building walls. Faint cries for help can be heard\nby any PC making a successful Listen check (DC 10). The cries\nare difficult to pinpoint above the roaring of the fire.\n\nTwo infirmary workers tend the minor injuries of three inn\npatrons who escaped the blaze. If the PCs question spectators,\nthey learn that the north side of the building erupted in flames\nand that no one seems to know who started the fire or where\nthey went. No one in the lower floor was killed, and all on that\nfloor were evacuated. A young woman in the crowd cries for\nher four-year-old son Timbo, who is stuck in a room on the\nsecond floor. From the south side, an old woman stares\nthrough a window, obviously trapped on the upper story.\n\nOnly part of the inn is ablaze, although the fire spreads in\ntime. The north side has a 40-foot-wide hole burned through\nit, allowing entrance through a wall of flames. The lower level’s\nfront door (marked A on the map) is also blocked by fire. The\ntwo back rooms (marked B and C respectively) are fully afire,\nand the first person who sets foot in either room must dodge\na falling rafter.\n\nThe stairs to the upper floor are only on fire in one place\n(marked D on the map), which collapses under 200 pounds or\nmore of weight. A successful Reflex saving throw (DC 10)\nnegates the fall. Anyone falling takes 1d4 points of damage.\n\nOn the upper floor, the blast has destroyed much of the\nnorth section of floor; anyone walking in must succeed at a\nReflex saving throw (DC 10) or take 1d6 points of damage from\nthe fall as well as regular fire damage.\n\nThe young boy, Timbo, cries for his mother in the room\nmarked E on the map of the inn. He is protected from the fire\nby a closed door. At the point marked F on the map, an 80-\nyear-old woman calls softly for help are she stares through the\nsouth window to the crowd 20 feet below. If she is rescued, the\nwoman, Granny Hazel, thanks her rescuers by giving them her\nblack shawl for good luck. (She set the fire and was given the\nblack shawl by Barbas, but she remembers none of it.)\n\nCreatures (EL —): Neither Timbo (male human Com1; hp 1)\nnor Granny Hazel (female human Com1; hp 3) pose any threat\nto the party.\n\nDevelopment: If the PCs are still in the vicinity of the inn by\n6:00 p.m., they hear the explosion at the power supplies ware-\nhouse. See below for details.\n\n6:00 P.M. Power Supplies Warehouse (Area 19). Smoke pours\nout of the open door to the power supplies warehouse, and a\nman in black stands on the building’s roof, cackling maniacally.\nA small crowd has gathered below.\n\nNone in the crowd saw the blast, but all heard it. No watch-\nmen or infirmary workers arrive on the scene for 10 minutes,\n\nthough some watchmen in the nearby guard towers might\nnotice that something is amiss if they aren’t watching the fire\nat the inn.\n\nOnly the inside of the warehouse is burning. Though all oil\nstored in the warehouse was consumed in the blast, there are\nstill several tons of lumber on fire. At the point marked A on\nthe map rests a ladder that leads 20 feet up to the smoke-filled\nceiling. Obscured by smoke at the top of the ladder is a trap\ndoor. Anyone fumbling in the smoke for the trap door must\nsucceed at a Fortitude saving throw (DC 15) or take 1d6 points\nof subdual damage each round.\n\nAt the point marked B on the map, a stack of lumber has\nbeen destabilized by the blast. When the stack is first hit by\nanything (including a blast of water), the entire stack will fall,\ndealing 1d6+2 points of damage to anyone within 10 feet who\nfails a Reflex saving throw (DC 12) to leap out of the way.\n\nOn the roof, the man in black laughs loudly until attacked,\nat which time he recoils, stops laughing, and surrenders. The\nman is the town stockmaster, Ross Tanquen; he is a portly fel-\nlow with a thin mustache, black cape, black cap, and black ban-\ndanna. Barbas persuaded him to change clothes, swapping his\ntypical apparel for all-black clothing stolen by Barbas.\n\nCreatures (EL —): Ross Tanquen (Exp1; hp 4) retains vague\nmemories of his conversation with a thin man calling himself\nZante Barbas and was somehow lulled into thinking that setting\nfire to the warehouse was wise. He has little useful information\nfor his rescuers, however.\n\nDevelopment: One spectator at the warehouse is the town\nclothier, Lana Linden (female human Exp1). She knows that\nseveral black garments were stolen from her shop (area 33)\nand recognizes the black apparel worn by Tanquen. PCs who\nmake a successful Listen check (DC 20) overhear Lana report-\ning this to a nearby watchman. The stockmaster does not recall\nhow he obtained the black apparel; when confronted by the\nwatchman, he protests, “I don’t even like the color black!”\n\n6:30 P.M. Fire Station (Area 30). In the alley next to the fire\nstation—at the point marked A on the map—a city watchman\nwearing a black belt is wrapping an arrow with an oil-saturated\ncloth. The watchman, Ulmo Quince, has been charmed by\nZante Barbas. His sole objective is to shoot a flaming arrow\ninto the fire station so that it ignites the oil casks positioned at\nthe point marked B on the map. \n\nIf no one is at the fire station or the door is open, Ulmo\nwalks in, lights the arrow, and fires it at the casks. If someone\nhas returned to the fire station, he lights the arrow as he\nknocks on the door with his foot. When the door is opened, he\nfires the arrow at the casks if a straight shot exists. If he\nmisses, he continues to try until he succeeds or is overcome.\nIf he succeeds, the casks explode in 2 rounds, dealing 1d8\npoints of damage to anyone within 5 feet of the casks. The fire\nspreads slowly.\n\nIf Blaze and Stanch are in the fire station when the casks\nexplode, the horses panic and bolt for the street. After the\nexplosion, Ulmo wanders about the streets, trying to remem-\nber what happened to his partner, with whom he was patrolling\nnear the library (area 29). He does his best to quench any fires\nbefore him.\n\nCreature (EL 1): Ulmo Quince has typical watchman statis-\ntics (see the “Key NPCs in Powderkeg” sidebar). The black belt\nwas given to him by Zante Barbas while he was charmed.\n\n7\n\nTINDERBOX\n\n\n\n8  may/june 2001\n\nTINDERBOX\n\n7:00 P.M. Water Tower (Area 61). The water tower is not on\nfire. A charmed, twelve-year-old stableboy named Jesse Mott\nis lying on the ground (marked A on the map), next to a fallen\nladder (marked B on the map). His clothes smolder, although\nthe oil was consumed in the blast. The explosion coupled with\nthe fall reduces Jesse to –5 hit points, but he stabilizes at –9\nhit points before infirmary workers arrive to save him.\n\nCreature (EL —): Zante Barbas commanded Jesse (Com1; hp\n4 at full) to set the water tower on fire using an oil flask. When\nJesse ignited the flask, it exploded in his hand, knocking him\nand the ladder to the ground. No one is near the water tower\nwhen Jesse falls. If the PCs help Jesse, they notice he wears a\nblack headband (given to him by Barbas). Shards of glass lay\naround him and the ladder. A small hole (marked C on the map)\nwas punched in the top slope of the water tower above the\nwatermark. When Jesse regains consciousness, he remembers\nnothing about the incident.\n\nDevelopment: The next attack occurs at the torchrunner\nstatue in the town square at 7:45 P.M. The explosion is very\nloud and can be heard all over the town. Regardless of where\nthey are, Jonathan and Joshua whip the horses toward the\ntown square; the PCs must decide whether to go along.\n\n7:45 P.M. Town Square (Area 32). Barbas throws a missile from\nhis necklace of missiles at the statue of the torchrunner,\ndestroying it. Nothing else is damaged, and no one is in the\nsquare when the blast occurs. However, dozens of people\narrive in a minute or two to survey the damage. Jonathan and\nJoshua Spring rush to the scene with the fire wagon and put\nout the fire if they can. Cheers erupt from the crowd, which\n\nincludes a pair of town watchmen. These\ntwo are the guards of the front door of\nthe palace (area 13). They have left their\nposts to investigate the explosion and\ntake statements from everyone present.\nThey are baffled because they were\nlooking at the statue when it exploded\nand saw no one. (Barbas’s Hide check\nbeat the guards’ Spot checks.) If\nreminded of their guard duty, they let\nother town watchmen take statements so\nthat they can return to the palace.\n\nWintergreen arrives on the scene\njust after 8:00 P.M. If he notices that the\ntwo watchmen have left their post at the\npalace doors, he scolds them and orders\nthem to return at once. He remains at\nthe scene to make sure that the statue is\ndoused and the bystanders are properly\nquestioned.\n\nDevelopment: At 8:00 P.M., Barbas\nenters the unguarded palace disguised\nas a town watchman. He wears studded\nleather armor and carries a shortbow\nand longsword. Alert PCs might question\nwhy a city watchman would be walking\nalone, since they typically move in pairs.\n\n8:00 P.M. Burgomaster’s Palace (Area\n13). Zante Barbas enters the front doors\n(marked A on the map) dressed as a\n\ntown watchman. He moves past Wintergreen, who goes out to\ninvestigate the explosion at the statue. Barbas works his way\nthrough the palace until he reaches the foyer outside the\nBurgomaster’s bedchamber, confronting the guards at the\npoints marked with an asterisk (*) on the map. Taking advan-\ntage of his disguise, Barbas sneak attacks the first guard, drop-\nping him to –5 hit points. For the next 2 rounds, Barbas attacks\nthe second guard, dropping him to –4 hit points. Barbas pulls\nthe two guards to the room marked I on the map before enter-\ning the Burgomaster’s quarters, marked T on the map.\n\nAwakened by the ruckus outside his room, the Burgomaster\nis not surprised by Zante Barbas and recognizes the arsonist\nimmediately. The Burgomaster shouts for help, but none of the\nremaining palace guards hear his cries.\n\nTactics: If the PCs are not present, the fight between the\nBurgomaster and Zante Barbas plays out as follows:\n\nOn Round 1, Zante Barbas drops his longsword (which he\nconsiders too awkward), draws his dagger as a free action, and\nlunges at Burgomaster Capulin, who is watching the events in\nthe town square through a window. Catching the Burgomaster\nflat-footed, Barbas stabs him for 10 points of damage. Capulin\nreaches for a dagger on the night stand near his bed.\n\nOn Round 2, Barbas misses Capulin. In a lucky stroke, the\nBurgomaster hits Barbas for 2 points of damage. Capulin tries\nto slip past the rogue toward the chamber’s exit. Barbas gains\nan attack of opportunity, however, and strikes Capulin for 7\npoints of damage, reducing the Burgomaster to –1 hit points.\n\nOn Round 3, Barbas slices Capulin’s throat, dropping him\nbelow –10 hit points. He quickly wipes his dagger on Capulin’s\nsleeve and picks up the longsword while exiting the chamber.\n\n\n\nIf he manages to flee the palace, Barbas leaps onto the fire\nwagon in the town square (assuming the wagon is unguarded)\nand drives the wagon toward the town gates. (He will be seated\ndirectly in front of where the decanter of endless water is\ncontained; if someone yells the command word “Geyser,”\nBarbas is blown off the wagon and trampled by Blaze and\nStanch, taking 2d4 points of subdual damage from the blast of\nwater, 2d4+6 points of damage from the horses’ hooves, and\n2d6 points of damage from the wheels of the fire wagon.)\n\nIf he cannot steal the fire wagon, Barbas hurries to the gate\non foot and uses his ring of jumping to leap over the wall.\n\nIf he mounts the fire wagon, he steers it toward the gate.\nHe has one 4-HD missile remaining on his necklace of missiles\nand uses it to blast his way through the gate. The explosion\ncauses the fire wagon’s horses to buck, forcing Barbas to make\na Reflex saving throw (DC 15) or tumble from the wagon. If the\nsave fails, Barbas takes 1d4 points of damage from the fall and\nruns through the burning gate, suffering attacks by archers on\nthe watch towers. If he escaped the hail of arrows, he heads\ntoward the nearby forest and tries to lose himself in the woods,\nleaving Powderkeg in flames.\n\nCreatures (EL 4 for Zante Barbas): Statistics for Burger-\nmaster Almon Capulin and Zante Barbas are given in the “Key\nNPCs of Powderkeg” sidebar. If you are running this adven-\nture for PCs of 2nd level or higher, use the adjusted statistics\nfor Barbas presented in the “Scaling the Adventure” sidebar.\n\nPowderkeg\nPowderkeg is a municipal corporation managed by agents of\nthe king. It has 325 permanent residents, as the only persons\nallowed to live here are those so permitted by the king (or in\npractice, Powderkeg’s royally appointed Burgomaster.) Those\nso allowed are engaged in the management and maintenance of\nthe city or in the manufacturing of materials needed for this\npurpose. The community is managed by Burgomaster Almon\nCapulin with the assistance of his advisor, Savin Wintergreen.\nCapulin reports directly to the king twice a month, while\nWintergreen handles the day-to-day operations of Powderkeg.\nAll businesses and features of Powderkeg are owned by the\ncity, and their caretakers are paid salaries rather than allowed\nto reap their own profits. Twice monthly, the town treasury\npays employees and maintenance costs. The rest of the “take”\ntravels by armed caravan to the king.\n\nThe residents of Powderkeg are selected from skilled pro-\nfessionals in major cities of the region. Powderkeg residents all\nknow they are in the service business and are always willing\nto help travelers. Most citizens know each other by occupa-\ntion. Although the inhabitants come from all walks of life and\nall parts of the kingdom, most are lawful. Unless noted else-\nwhere, each inhabitant is a 1st- level expert with average sta-\ntistics and the Skill Focus feat in their area of expertise. There\nis no official policy against hiring non-humans, but Burgomaster\nCapulin shies away from hiring non-humans because it creates\n“unnecessary tension.”\n\nAlmost all inhabitants live in the backrooms of businesses,\nsome with families. Most administrators live in city-owned\napartments and residents, as administrative buildings have no\nliving quarters. Powderkeg also maintains farms outside the\ncity walls, which bring in foodstuffs for the inhabitants and\nbusinesses. Few residents own horses or carriages, although\nsome use them for work. \n\nThe shop proprietors have their prices set by the city. In\nPowderkeg, everything costs 150% of Player’s Handbook\nrates. High quality goods cost 200% of their normal value.\n\nAll residents carry identification papers showing their\noccupation within the city. These papers allow free movement\nin the city, purchase of municipal goods and services at 75%\nof Player’s Handbook prices, and eventual reimbursement for\nbusiness-related purchases. Anyone claiming to be a resident\nwithout proper papers is brought before Capulin or\nWintergreen and either banished from the town (if the\noffender has an otherwise good reputation or the infraction is\nrelatively minor) or carted off to the capital city for incarcer-\nation (if the offender is a known troublemaker or the offense\nis grievous).\n\nSince Powderkeg is a municipal corporation with almost no\npermanent inhabitants, there are few chronic urban problems.\nIt is amazingly clean. No one is unemployed, and there are few\nthieves or other malefactors. The city watchmen are attentive,\nwell-trained, and well-paid. They patrol in pairs, reporting any\nsuspicious doings to their superior, Commander Pollard\nBanyan. Most citizens do not hesitate to call the watchmen if\ncircumstances demand. All residents know that uncontrolled\nfires endanger the wooden city, quickly reporting them to the\nwatch or fire station (area 30). Workers from the infirmary\n(area 70) have the Heal skill.\n\nDuring the day, the city gates (area 1) are always open.\nTravelers can enter the city when the gates are open and are\nrequired to check in at the registration and receiving station\n(area 74) before entering Powderkeg proper. After sunset the\ngates close, although they can be opened if anyone needs\nentrance or egress during the night. After sunset, half of all\nencounters are with patrolling watchmen.\n\nThe buildings of Powderkeg are described below. Certain\nbuildings are detailed earlier in the module. None of the build-\nings are larger than two stories (30 feet high). Only the palace\n(area 13), city hall (area 25), apartments (area 31), hostelry\n(area 55), inn (area 56), caravanserai (area 60), and infirmary\n(area 70) are two stories.

Her accommodations are\nsparsely furnished, but her garden is plentiful.\n\nCreature (EL —): Silverbell does not share some of her fel-\nlow druids’ loathing of city life, preferring to live in harmony\nwith good-aligned urban dwellers.\nk Cassia Silverbell, Female Human Drd5 (Obad-hai): hp 31;\n\nuse Table 2–36 in the DUNGEON MASTER’s Guide (page 52) to\ngenerate complete statistics and equipment, if necessary.\n\n29. Library. Cazaba Seron, the town librarian, maintains the\nwell-stocked collection of books that must be read on the\npremises. There are three books that radiate magic in Seron’s\nprivate bookcase: a treatise on horticulture has a wand of lev-\nitate (5th-level; 23 charges) secretly sewn into the spine, a\nbook of riddles has four spells (arcane mark, see invisibility,\nmessage, and secret page) hidden by secret page spells, and\nSeron’s spellbook contains 2d4 cantrips, 1d6 1st-level spells,\nand 1d4 2nd-level spells.\n\nThe door to the library is locked at 6:00 P.M. (Seron returns\nhome to his flat at area 31 and doesn’t return until 8:00 A.M.\nthe following morning.)\n\nUsing his Open Lock skill to pick the lock, Zante stashes an\nunconscious watchmen named Siris Scrag behind some dusty\nbookshelves. When Siris awakens around 7:00 P.M., he cannot\nfree himself from his bonds or the black gag covering his\nmouth. If he is discovered and freed, he tells the PCs (or any-\none willing to listen) that he was attacked from behind and\nawakened to find himself bound by ropes. His studded leather\narmor, tunic, and weapons were stolen by Barbas; Siris does\nnot know who attacked him and stole his stuff.\n\nCreatures (EL —): Cazaba Seron has done some adventur-\ning, but an encounter with a band of gnoll bandits in the\nnearby forest changed his mindset. He is eager to talk to other\nwizards about their adventuring careers and possibly\nexchange spells with them.\nk Cazaba Seron, Male Human Wiz3: hp 8; use Table 2–43\n\nin the DUNGEON MASTER’s Guide (page 57) to generate complete\nstatistics and equipment, if necessary.\n\nSiris Scrag is a typical watchman (male human War1); his\nstatistics are given in the “Key NPCs In Powderkeg” sidebar.\n\n30. Fire Station. This building is more fully detailed earlier in\nthe adventure. Areas A and B on the map show the positions\nof the charmed watchman and oil casks respectively.\n\nJonathan and Joshua Springer look after this facility. The\nwalls of the main room are adorned with firefighting equip-\nment, including four buckets of water (at the point marked C\non the map), twelve handaxes (at the point marked D on the\nmap), and five 40-pound sandbags (at the point marked E).

The statue stands atop a\ncarved stone pedestal embedded in the ground.\n\n33. Clothier. Almost any kind of clothing can be bought here,\nwith prices based on the social class of the garments. The\nclothier herself, Lana Linden (female human Exp1), knows that\nseveral black garments were stolen from her shop recently.\n\n34. Tailor. New clothing can be made and old clothes repaired\nhere. The tailor, Hal Jollarzen (male human Exp1), is an exact-\ning and somewhat eccentric older man.\n\nFire Station (Area 30)\nOne square = 5 feet\n\nWater Tower (Area 61)\nOne square = 5 feet\n\n\n\n13\n\n35. Cobbler. Dar Roble, a retired soldier, makes a living as a\ncobbler here. The building contains shoemaking equipment, a\nspare longsword, and a chest containing 40 gp, 50 sp, and\nDar’s war medals.\n\nCreature (EL —): Roble retired because he was sickened by\nthe sight of death. He much prefers the quiet life of a cobbler.\nk Dar Roble, Male Human Ftr3: hp 29; use Table 2–37 in\n\nthe DUNGEON MASTER’s Guide (page 53) to generate complete\nstatistics and equipment, if necessary.\n\n36. Furrier. Jack Longan, a grizzled ranger, lives here when\nhe’s not sleeping in the woods. There are many furs here,\nalong with spare shortbows, handaxes, and skinning knives.\n\nCreature (EL —): Longan is not an adventurer and doesn’t\ncare much for hunting anything other than animals.\nk Jack Longan, Male Human Rgr3: hp 27; use Table 2–40\n\nin the DUNGEON MASTER’s Guide (page 54) to generate complete\nstatistics and equipment, if necessary.\n\n37.

Originally a\nbrothel, this was torn down a few\nmonths ago by order of the king and will\nsoon be built into a second inn.\n\n45. Nightclub. Erica Balsam, a retired\nrogue, runs this establishment from 8:00\nP.M. until 3:00 A.M. At least two city\nwatchmen patrol nearby every night.\nGambling takes place on a small scale in\na back room, with a 5–2 house win ratio\ncarefully monitored by the city. (Illegal\nmarked cards and loaded dice are tucked\naway for special occasions.) Balsam’s\nfive employees—a singer, a cook, a bar-\n\nmaid, a bartender, and a bouncer—live in rooms near Balsam’s\nin the back.\n\nCreature (EL —): A former cat burglar, Balsam got this job\nafter running illegal dice games in a club in the nearby city of\nBridgeton. A representative of Powderkeg was among those\ncaught in the bust, and since Balsam refused to name names,\nhe offered to post her bail and give her a job running this club.\nk Erica Balsam, Female Human Rog4: hp 16; use Table 2–40\n\nin the DUNGEON MASTER’s Guide (page 55) to generate complete\nstatistics and equipment, if necessary. \n\nTreasure: Balsam’s room contains a suit of masterwork\nleather armor that has hidden linings containing 30 pp and 13\ngems (100 gp each).\n\n46–53.

A conical roof covers the drum, which holds\nabout a week’s worth of water for the city. Water is drawn up\nfrom wellsprings under Powderkeg by a heavy pumping mech-\nanism underneath the drum, between the stilts.\n\nThe water tower figures prominently in the adventure.\n\n62–63.

Feats: Iron Will, Skill Focus—Diplomacy, Skill\nFocus—Profession (administrator).\n\nBurgomaster Almon Capulin is Powderkeg’s chief bureaucrat,\na position he has held since the city’s opening three years ago. A\nman in his late fifties, Capulin is never afraid to make decisions.\nThough he leaves most of the day-to-day internal business of the\ncity to his advisor, Wintergreen, he keeps the interests of the city\nand the king at heart. He is not a politician but rather a compe-\ntent civil servant. He is soft-spoken and usually allows the more\ncharismatic Wintergreen to act as his spokesman except when\ndealing with dignitaries. Capulin works a full ten hours each day,\nthen retires to his room in the palace (area 13) for the night. He\nis there for the duration of the scenario.\n\nk Savin Wintergreen, Male Human Exp5: CR 4; Medium-Size\nHumanoid (5 ft. 8 in. tall); HD 5d6+5; hp 23; Init +0; Spd 30 ft.; AC\n10; Atk +3 melee (1d4/crit 19–20, dagger); or +3 melee (1d3+1 subd-\nual, unarmed strike); AL LG; SV Fort +2, Ref +1, Will +7 (includes\nIron Will feat); Str 12, Dex 10, Con 13, Int 15, Wis 13, Cha 16.\n\nSkills: Appraise +10, Bluff +11, Diplomacy +11, Gather\nInformation +13 (includes Skill Focus feat), Innuendo +9,\nKnowledge (commerce) +10, Listen +4 (includes Alertness feat),\nProfession (administrator) +9, Sense Motive +8, Speak Language\n(any three), Spot +5 (includes Alertness feat).

He is devoted to his job and puts noth-\ning above the city. He is intelligent and capable of dealing with\ncrises. Wintergreen employs a smooth, reasoned approach when\ndealing with others and is charismatic enough that Capulin trusts\nhim to act as city spokesman for all but the most important cer-\nemonies. Though healthy at age 45, Wintergreen is tired the\nnight of the adventure. He worries for the safety of the city and\nits chief administrator, whom he thinks is taking the Barbas\nthreat too lightly. Wintergreen will take whatever precautions\nare necessary to insure their security.

Barbas has little respect for the rights of\nothers. He fancies himself more intelligent than his foes and\nenjoys taunting victims with diabolical puzzles and riddles.\nHowever, these riddles are always rigged in Barbas’s favor, as he\nhates to lose. He can be distracted by clever puzzles, especially\nif accompanied by the suggestion that the creator is smarter than\nhim. Now 34 years old, he has spent the past two years languish-\ning in Powderkeg’s prison (area 10). During this incarceration,\nBarbas kept in fine physical condition and nurtured a deep hatred\nfor Capulin and his employees. He wears black garb. During the\nnight of the adventure, he wears a black overshirt and carries\nsmall black garments stolen from a local clothier.\n\nWhile infiltrating Powderkeg’s palace, Barbas dons the\napparel and equipment of a town watchmen: a simple tunic, suit\nof studded leather armor, shortbow, and longsword.

Forgotten Realms campaign world setting involved, although the adventure can 'easily' be fit into any campaign. Many encounters can be strengthened or weaken. Simply use the advancement rules of 3rd edition to get as challenging an encounter as you wish. ENJOY!\n\n\t\tADVENTURE BACKGROUND\n\tA major merchant company in Waterdeep, called 'Berrico Trading Company', has been doing business for years with a merchant group called 'Coster Y', out of Baldurs Gate which is run and owned by a Trellick Amaze (Rogue4/Expert2). A fairly new merchant company has set up shop in Baldur's Gate and wants to cut out Coster Y, and start doing business with 'Berrico Trading Company'.\n\t'Berrico Trading Company' is run by a female elven Rogue named Abyl Berrico (Rogue8/Shadow1), who gained the business through her notoriety as a hero from adventuring and also for her liason with the now defunct Rogue's Guild in Waterdeep. Or so they think. The Rogue's Guild still exists, but operates in secret out a section in Skullport. In fact, the Guild mostly deals in legitimate business, as best they can. The Guild leader, an Aron Lonvall (Rogue10/Shadow3), after being shutdown of most illegal operations in Waterdeep, decided to help Abyl set up this trading company, as a front for the Guild. Aron is slowly making a comeback, as quietly and secretly as possible.\n\tThis new merchant company, called Spry Entreprises,  in Baldur's Gate will do whatever they can to gain Abyl's business. Anything. As will be detailed in this adventure, they will try to sabotage Coster Y, and when that proves ineffective, they will try to shut them down completely with an attempt at assassination and then a full-out assault. Spry Enterprises is being led by a Fighter called Barok (pronounced 'Bah-Rock') Trizzle (Ftr4). Spry Entreprises is actually a front for Barok, who is a very ambitious leader from the Mercenary Guild out of Elturel. Rumor suggests he has links to the Zhentarim (AKA Ring Of Iron) & possible slaver ties.\n\n\n\t\tADVENTURE HOOK\n\t-The best way to hook the PC's is to have them owe a debt to Aron Lonvall of the Rogue's Guild from Waterdeep. Maybe Aron did a favor for them in the past, and is now asking for their aid in delivering an important cargo to Coster Y in Baldur's Gate. Ofcourse, it will be Abyl Berrico asking for the favor, and this may throw the group for a loop in the beginning. Abyl will try and keep the link between her and the Guild secret for as long as possible.\n\t-PC's check around the city and find a lead asking for a group of adventurer's to deliver a precious cargo to Baldur's Gate.\n\t-PC's are known for some recent help in the city or heroic deeds and are asked to see Abyl Berrico for a meeting and possible job.\n\n\n\t\t\tCHAPTER I\n\n\n\t\tTHE HIRING\n\tYou find yourselves in a backroom office in a warehouse of the 'Berrico Trading Company'. You were led here by two humans, who seem to be the atypical bodyguard type, not much to say and thick bodies. Standing before you is a female elf with very sharp features, a lithe and quite sexy body, and a very professional demeanor. She is wearing a green cape which doesn't do a great deal in disguising her runic laden leather armor and high boots. She says \"Welcome to Berrico Trading Company. I am Abyl Berrico, and will be your boss for a shortwhile.\". She grins, turns her back, walks to her desk, and then sits down. \"Please everyone, have a seat. Anything to eat or drink?\".\n\n\tThe PC's will be brought decent red wine, beef jerky, and some cheese sqaures by one of her lackeys.\n\n\tAbyl's personal bodyguards are (4) four F3/R2; hp 34each. Stats listed at back of adventure.\n\n\t***Let the PC's ask some questions*** :\n\n\tWhy do you need us for this job? Why not a regular caravan master? \"It seems I'm all out of good help and you come with good recommendations.\" \n\t\t***If pressed - \"Let's just say I owe a favor to someone who you owe a favor to.\".\n\n\tWho might this be? \"A friend.\".\n\n\tWhat if we say no? \"Let's just put it this way. Someone helped you out along the way sometime ago, and now it's your turn to return the favor. Besides, I'm not the kind of girl who takes no for an answer. The pay is good.\"\n\n\tHow much? \"A total of 400gp each. This job shouldn't take more than 2 months, here, there, and back. It's much more then I pay my normal help. You'll also be well on your way to repaying your debt to our mutual friend.\".\n\n\tWhat is the cargo \"Didn't your mother teach you about manners? Your business is delivery. Simple as that. The cargo is best left unknown, for your protection and mine.\".\n\n\tWhere are we going? \"You are to deliver the cargo to a male human named Trellick Amaze. He owns the Coster Y. A major trading coster in Baldur's Gate. Yes, you're going to see the Gate. He'll give you a cargo to bring back to me.\".\n\n\tIs there expected trouble? \"Trellick has reported some bandit activity to the east of Baldur's Gate, but it should poise no threat here. If there is trouble, you're being paid handsomly to deal with it.\".\n\n\tAnswer any other questions as logically as possible. Change answers as appropiate to your game.\n\n\tThe PC's are given 2 donkey's who will pull a covered wagon holding 4 crates the size of 3'x3'. The crates are not trapped nor magically sealed. Two crates contain small bucklers & medium shields. The remaining two crates hold crossbow's and ammunition. A locked box (Pick Lock DC 25) is concealed at the bottom of crate #4 (Search DC22). The small box is trapped (Search DC 22/Disable Device 19) with a poison needle (type Ungol Dust DC 15 Initial 1cha Secondary 1d6 Cha + 1 Cha* permanent). The box contains illegal uncut gems totalling about 6,000gp value.\n\n\n\n\t\tOFF TO THE GATE\n\tDistance to Baldur's Gate is 635miles, give or take 10 miles.\n\n\tOn foot : 26 days to reach Baldur's Gate ***24 miles per day\n\tOn horseback : 18 days to reach Baldur's Gate ***32 miles per day\n\nDAY 1-4 : No encounters - PC's will pass through a small village named Oakhurst (from WOTC Sunless Citadel). On or around the 2nd day of the journey. \n\nDAY 5 the PC's will enter the village of Daggerford. Make up rumors as needed. Maybe a little side trek? They will be able to stay in Greatshout Inn, named after the duke himself; Pwyll Greatshout F5.\n\nDAY 7 : You have travelled almost a week with nary a problem. You've passed some other travellers, on foot and on horseback, and a large-sized caravan enroute to Waterdeep. The weather has been healthy, although a bit too dry and hot at times, but today you are travelling in a decent downpour which has cooled the countryside a good bit. The rain started a few minutes after breaking camp. All of a sudden, you see dismembered hands coming out of the grass and weeds from your left. There is too many to count!\n\tCheck for surprise using Listen Checks DC 10. The PC's will be attacked by 15 Crawling Claws-Faerun page 29.\n\n -Crawling Claws (15) : CR 1/3; Size Diminutive; HD 1d10; hp 6; Init +0; Spd 20ft.; AC 15 (+4 size, +1 natural); Attacks Claw +4 melee; Damage 1; SA Smite fallen; SQ Construct, Immunities, SR 10; SV Fort +0, Ref +0, Will -3; AL Neutral; Str 10, Dex 10, Con -, Int -, Wis 5, Cha 5\n\n\nDAY 8-10 : No encounters\n\nDAY 11 : Have PC's make a Spot check DC 14 to notice a group of large birds approaching from the angled rear; northeast. If no one noticed, the birds will attack using their Fly By Attack feat. If noticed, the group will circle around group to see if they provoke any attacks. If PC's dont attack, there is a 60% chance the birds will seek easier prey. A 2nd Spot check at DC 15 to notice that the birds are armed with sheathed javelins.\n\tLarge orange colored birds with atleast 20' wingspans approach from the northeast and then fly-by overhead to the south. They begin to circle back about 100 yards ahead of you...\n\t10 Aarakocra-Faerun page 11. 5hp each. This flock of Aarakocra are a bit on the wild side with some evil intent, and just for the thrill, will likely attack the PC's.\n\n-Aarakocra (10) : CR 1/2; Size Medium; HD 1d8; hp 5; Init +2 (dex); Spd 20ft, fly 90ft (average); AC 13 (+2 dex, +1 natural); Attacks 2 talons +0 melee, or javelin +3 ranged; Damage Talon 1d4-1, or javelin 1d6-1; SA Bite, summon Large air elemental; SV Fort +0, Ref +4, Will +2; AL Neutral Evil; Str 9,Dex 15, Con 10, Int 10, Wis 11, Cha 10\n\nLanguages Spoken : Common, Auran\n\nSkills and Feats : Craft (any one) +4; Knowledge (nature) +4; Listen +4; Spot +4; Wilderness Lore +4; Flyby Attack\n\n\nDAY 12 : PC's will come across the Way Inn. A friendly wayside tavern and inn, the PC's can rest here eating very good food and good rest. PC's learn that they'll be passing over Trollclaw Ford about 6-7 days before reaching Baldur's Gate and to be careful of trolls who are known to frequent the hilly terrain. A fellow adventure warns not to cross after dark. ***Depending on mode of travel, the PC's might reach the Way Inn sooner than the 12th day. Use as appropiate.\n\nDAY 13-20 : No encounters\n\n\n\t\tAMBUSH WITH HELP\nDAY 21 : The PC's will have been moving through some hilly terrain for the last day and then soon cross the Trollclaw Ford with no problems. \n\t\n\tThe road has purposefully turned due south here to avoid heading deeper into the Trollclaw Hills. The water is as close to black as possible and looks quite dirty, as far upstream and downstream as you can see. You see the path rise up out of the river on the far side about 140' away.\n\n\tHave the PC's make a Knowledge (DC 10 History-local) or even a Wilderness Lore (DC 12) to know that water remains black to this day ever since the death of the diety Bhaal at the Boareskyr Bridge.\n\n\tAbout 30mins after getting past the ford, the PC's will be ambushed by some hired bandits from Spry Enterprises. The PC's will get some help from two (2) humans who work for Spry Enterprises! They will help defeat the hired bandits, so they can slip a forged note into the pouch of a dead bandit that says \"You will attack the small caravan, leaving no survivors, and will bring the cargo to the pre-arranged meeting place outside the Gate.\". The note has the seal of the Coster Y company run by Trellick Amaze.\n\tAs you come up a small crest, ahead of you is a small group of men, who are apparently having problems with their wagon. A plume of smoke seems to be rising from the rear of the wagon. They are holding a flag for you to see. One yells out \"Well met travellers! We could use some help here. We've been attacked!\"\n\t\n\tThe flag is stolen and designates they are with a merchant company called Coster Y. They will try and befriend the group into helping them. They all have concealed short swords hidden (DC 22) under some thick garments in the back of the wagon. One (1) bandit (leader Mexin) hides a light crossbow under his clothes (Spot DC 18).\n\tTwo (2) human rogues remain hidden (Spot DC 24) high in two trees nearby and will help PC's once combat begins. The roadside bandits are unaware of the rogues hidden in the trees.\n\t\n\tQUESTIONS :\n\tWhat has happened? : \"We were just attacked by some bandits! They headed south along the roadway. They' ve taken our goods and valuables, and lit the rest of what they couldn't carry on fire.\".\n\n\tWhere were you headed? \"To Waterdeep with cargo. We are from the Trading Company called Coster Y back in Baldurs Gate. Our boss is certainly going to be pissed.\".\n\n\tWho is your boss? \"Trellick Amaze. A merchant in Baldurs Gate.\"\n\n\tOnce questioning is over, one will ask if they can accompany PC's back to Baldur's Gate. He states \"Safety in numbers\".\n\n\tRoll a Bluff check at +1 against the PC's Sense Motive. If PC's win roll, they believe something is amiss. Some of the men seem fidgety and a bit nervous. If PC's beat roll by 10 or more, the PC's catch a wink between the supposed leader and another bandit and will also be CERTAIN they are lying.\n\n\tThe bandits will strike once the PC's accept them into group (or it seems unlikely of that). As they head south along the High Road, the bandits will retrieve their hidden weapons. IF PC's GO TO SEARCH WAGON, the bandits will attack right away by rushing to get weapons.\n\n\tSeven bandits total.\n\n-Bandits, Roadway Ambush (6)-Nonst, Krusk, Manoy (female), Nimber, Lorkin, & Bellip, Human Ftr1; CR 1; Size M; HD 1d10+2; hp 10-15; Init +0; Spd 30 ft.; AC 14 (+3 studded leather, +1 small steel shield); Attack +3 melee, or +1 ranged; SV Fort +4, Ref +0, Will +1; AL NE; Str 15, Dex 11, Con 14, Int 11, Wis 13, Cha 10.\n\nLanguages Spoken: Common.\n\nSkills and feats: Climb +4, Handle animal +4, Hide +0, Listen +1, Move silently +0, Open lock +1, Spot +1, Swim +6; Power attack, Quick draw, Toughness.\n\nPossessions: Studded Leather, small steel shield, shortsword, punching dagger, 2d10+2gp 6d12+6sp\n\n-Bandit Leader, Mexin, Roadway Ambush, Human Ftr2 : CR 2; Size M (6 ft., 2 in. tall); HD 2d10; hp 20; Init +2 (+2 Dex); Spd 30 ft.; AC 17 (+2 Dex, +4 chainshirt, +1 small steel shield); Attack +5 melee, or +4 ranged; SV Fort +3, Ref +2, Will -2; AL NE; Str 16, Dex 15, Con 11, Int 12, Wis 7, Cha 10.\n\nLanguages Spoken: Common, Terran.\n\nSkills and feats: Climb +8, Craft +3, Handle animal +1, Heal +0, Hide +2, Knowledge +3, Listen +0, Move silently +2, Spot -2; Precise Shot, Combat Reflexes, Point Blank Shot, Weapon focus (light crossbow).\n\nPossessions: Chainshirt, small steel shield, masterwork light crossbow, 20 bolts, 10 masterwork bolts, shortsword, (2) potions of cure light wounds, 44gp, 63sp\n\n\n\tOnce combat ends, the two remaining rogues from the trees come down to talk to PC's. If any bandits are alive, these two will kill them off, if possible. Roop will secretly place the forged note into a pouch of a downed bandit (Pick Pocket +9) Vs. PC's Spot Checks. If noticed, the Rogue will pull out the note with style, stating \"look what I've found\". Use Bluff (+5) Vs. Sense Motive for PC's to suspect anything out of the ordinary.\n\n\tAny bandit left alive can be questioned, but they offer very little information. If intimidated (DC 14 or 16 if leader) into talking : \"Ok. Ok. If you let 'us/me' live, I can tell you something important.\" Will continue if PC's agree \"I don't think we were hired by Coster Y to do this. We met this man who says he works under Trellick, and said he wants this done. We were paid handsomely. That's all I know.\".\n\n\tThe two rogues are named Brollun and Roop (Refer to Cast of NPC's for stats). Roop says the following : \"We are from a merchant company called Spry Enterprises. Our boss got wind of this ambush and sent us out here as fast as we could to try and help you if anything happened. We beat them to the punch and took refuge in the trees over yonder. Seems we were needed out here after all. That Trellick and his Coster Y company are nothing but cutthroats anymore. They are responsible for the recent activities of banditry. Your boss would be wise to cut her ties with Coster Y. In fact, my boss has a proposition for your boss. Wanna hear?\".\n\tIf yes \"He wants you to bring this cargo to his warehouse in the Gate instead of to Trellick. He will pay 10% more for this shipment and all future shipments, than Trellick was going to pay, and will personally give each of you a reward as well. How 'bout it travellers?\".\n\t\n\tPC's have 3 choices :\n\tA-Return to Waterdeep without delivering cargo. (Returning will only make Abyl Berrico mad. Random encounters may                            \t    also take place on their journey back. Abyl will listen to what happened to the PCs, but she will send them back on their                           \t    way to Baldurs Gate)\n\tB-Deliver goods as promised to Coster Y. (Proceed to next section)\n\tC-Go with Rogues and deliver goods to Spry Enterprises. (Go to section SPRY ENTERPRISES)\n\n\tBrollun and Roop won't stop the PC's if they head back to Waterdeep or to Coster Y, although they do seem a bit undone. They'll leave with no insult to PC's, but simply telling them they've made a big mistake. They leave an open invitation for the PC's to visit to talk to their boss about future business when they arrive in Baldurs Gate.\n\n\n\t\tCOSTER Y IN BALDURS GATE\n\n\tAfter the ambush on the Trade Way, you've made it to the 'Gate with no other problems. The city walls appear ahead of you and soon get bigger and closer until you finally arrive at the gateway yielding entrance into the city proper. The guards at the gate inspect the cargo rather quickly and then give a quick look-over to each of you. You've gained entrance with no problems...\".\n\n\tRUMORS from Inn/Tavern's \n1-Bandits are attacking travellers on the road between here and Soubar & Elturel (true)\n2-Giants killed off an adventuring band on the plains to the south of Baldur's Gate (false)\n3-A murderer of little girls was finally caught and hung in Waterdeep. (semi-true)\n4-A new merchant company called Spry Enterprises has set up shop several months ago at the dismay of the merchant family Amaze who belongs to Coster Y. This will bring trouble. (true).\n5-Coster Y is actually a front for the local thieves guild. Social Alignment of NE (true).\n6-Spry Enterprises formed with ex-members from the thieves guild here in Baldurs Gate (false).\n7-Coster Y has been been visited by the guards recently for an attack against Spry's main warehouse. (true but false-Coster Y didn't do it)\n\n\tPC's should visit and deliver the cargo to Trellick Amaze in his yards near the dock district. His yards (refer to map) consist of 2 large rectangular warehouses, fenced off with brick and stone, complete with 4 guard towers. A rolling gate allows access along with a very strong stone door near the gates.\n\n\tYour first hint that you've found what you're looking for is the big painted black and gold sign that reads 'Coster Y' with 'An Amaze Family Business' written directly below. A chainlink rolling gate is currently closed and the yards seem protected by a 20' stone wall around its periphery. A large stone door is located about 10' to the side of the gates. You notice two towers about 30' high in the corners and a small building at ground level just inside the gates. Two guards nearby open the gates at your approach and bid welcome. The gates close behind you and you see two large rectangular warehouses made of stone & timber, with windows running the lengths along the top of the buildings about 25' up. A new guard approaches and asks you to follow him to Warehouse B, just to the left. You see plenty of laborers moving crates, boxes, barrels, and all sorts of containers to and fro. The warehouse itself has shelves as high as the ceiling, about 25' high. Stairs to the rear give access to some offices above. The guard says \"Wait right here. Trellick is on his way.\".\n\n\tLet PC's look a round a bit and maybe talk with some of the laborers.\n\n\tYou soon see a group of men, five in total, coming in your direction. Three appear to be wearing chainmail with bastard swords, one wearing thick maroon colored studded leather armor, and another, a thick elf, in very fine blue silk robes with some symbols of magic along its cuffs. The one wearing the colored leather armor extends a hand to each of you, one at a time, while saying \"Well met. Glad to see you have finally arrived safe and sound. I thought something may have happened to my precious cargo. I am Trellick Amaze, owner of Coster Y. This here\" he points to the silk robed human, \"is my right hand man, Prestice Lowenilla. Let's inspect the cargo shall we.\".\n\n\tPrestice (Wiz4) inspects each crate with help from some laborers, and soon comes out with a small wooden box. He holds the box for Trellick.\n\n\tTrellick asks you to follow him to his office at the back. Prestice brings the small wooden box that he took out of one of the crates with him. Once at the office, the guards remain just outside. The door is closed, leaving you with just Trellick and Prestice.\n\n\tLet the PC's describe whatever events they like. They should be quite wary of Trellick, especially after finding that letter.\n\n\tQUESTIONS :\n\n\tExplain yourself?:Do you really think I would steal from a mutual friend like Abyl Berrico? I did NOT authorize any attack against any of you or the cargo for that matter! Those dirty rotten scoundrels from that Spry Entreprises are probably behind this. If it's anyone you can't trust, it's them!\"\n\n\tWhat did we deliever? \"Nothing real important. Just some regular goods like any other time\" Bluff (+5) vs. PC's Sense Motive. Success means they think he is hiding something. He will not elaborate further about cargo though.\n\n\tSpry is offering 10% more per load \"Ludicrous to even trust that! My relations with Abyl is rock solid. She won't do business with them. I fear trouble from these guys.\".\n\n\tWhat about this letter? \"It's not mine. It has my seal and signature, but it is likely a forgery. Let Prestice here have that inspected.\".\n\n\tAnswer any other questions as best as possible.\n\t\n\tAfter talking with Trellick, read the following : \"Spry has only been here about five months. From what I've heard, they have been trying to gain business with others in this coster. I'm just one of a few companies making up this coster. I'm the northern most company, but the rest who make up this coster reach as far east as Iriaebor & Scornubel and as far south as Nashkel and even Athkatla. I don't know who is running that company, but I'll bet they have less than good intentions with anyone they deal with. Our reputation has diminished somewhat with city officials, as it seems we have been blamed for some things we havn't done. They might even be the reason behind the recent uprising of bandits to the east, between here and the roads heading to Soubar & Elturel. I know you have to get back to Waterdeep with my payment, but maybe you can delay that and run a small job for me? I can send message to Abyl about what has happened. She will understand I'm sure.\"\n\n\tThe PC's will be hired to investigate Spry Enterprises. They should accept the invite to visit Spry given by the two rogues (Brollun & Roop) they met on the road to get to 'know the building', before going in covert. Trellick's men might know of an old secret way into their main building, but don't know what dangers lie in the way. Getting the PC's this info will be free, but will take two (2) days. Trellick suggest hanging loose around the city, and to accept that open invitation to see what can be learned.\n\n\n\t\tSPRY ENTERPRISES\n\n\tIf the PC's visit Spry with the invite, they are escorted around the small warehouse, filled with crates, boxes, barrels, and other merchant-type containers. The warehouse is attached to another building, which houses the offices, bedrooms, and some storage rooms. The basement of this old building has an entrance to a small catacombs beneath the sewers. The PC's will also be shown the first floor of the office building. PC's should be given a map of the first floor & warehouse, but not the basement or second floor.\n\n\tNOTE***If the PC's took Roop & Brollun's offer to bring the cargo here instead, then he will give the PC's 10% of cargo value. PC's are then free to leave to go back to Waterdeep. Ofcourse, Abyl Berrico will be quite pissed that they sold the cargo to these outside upstarts! She recommends the PC's to make amends by getting back there ASAP, and helping Trellick Amaze in a merchant war with Spry Enterprises.\n\tIn the case they don't return to Waterdeep, the PC's will be visited by some of Trellicks 'people', telling them they are fools and made a bad mistake selling his cargo to Spry Enterprises. There is about to be a bad merchant war between the two, and they do their best to tell the PCs that Trellick is on the good side. You can get right back on track doing it this way, but ofcourse, the PC's should suffer an exp. point loss for bad judgement.***\n\n\tNOTE***Some creative or ingenious players might want to hide a PC inside the house during the tour using magic or a rogue's Hide skill. Warn the PC about the consequences, and then let him do as he wishes. Any alarm, and the PC will have to make haste. An attack now would not be wise. An attack at this point will have Barok, Roop, Brollun, and twelve (12) guards available for a fight!\n\n\tThe PC's best option to investigate is during late night AND through the catacombs beneath the sewers. Any other way has a high chance of raising the alarm (although breaking through the catacombs will most certainly set off the alarm The PC's won't know this ofcourse).\n\n1-MAIN LOBBY : This 15' x 10' room is the lobby for Spry Entreprises. No signs. No greetings. Just a plain old wooden desk and chair to the left of the front door. Behind the desk is 2 book shelves containing small boxes, office supplies, and some books.The floor is wooden planks, unshined and quite worn.\n\tDuring the day a female is sitting behind the desk, paid to look busy. Spry Enterprises is having a tough time getting business or even selling their goods. She will flee at first signs of trouble to get the guards. If she flees successfully, Baldur's Gate guardsmen will arrive 6-10 rounds later.\n\n2-WAREHOUSE ACCESS ROOM : This is an access room between the office building and warehouse. Several shelves have recently been built along the walls not containing any doors. The shelves contain helmets similar to what miners would use, heavy leather gloves, and some laborer's outfits which hang on pegs below the shelves.\n\t20 Laborer outfits are here along with 20 hard leather gloves and hard helmets. During the day there is a 15% chance a laborer/guard is present here, most likely walking through or changing into/out of gear.\n\n3-OUTLET STORE : This small room contains rows of shelves which form a small maze of sorts. Apparently a retail outlet for the locals.\n\tAny item in the Players Handbook is available at 10% less than book price, except for weapons & armor. During the day a guard is present 100% of the time; F1 hp 7.\n\tAfter 8pm, this room's door is locked. Good wooden door ; DC 18 to burst, 25 to pick / Hrd 5pts hp 15. Bashing the door will alert the 2 guards who roam at nighttime and they will call other guards before they go to investigate; 3-6 rounds. Bashing this door during the day will bring trouble within 1-2 rounds.\n\n4-RCREATION ROOM : A recreation room for the workers, containing two couches, a long oak table which has some goblets and plates with crumbs or uneaten food on it, surrounded by eight wooden chairs, and in the far corner is some free weights for those who like to work out.\n\tDuring the day there is a 25% chance that 1-3 laborer/guards are present, either working out or lounging around. Nothing else of interest is here. A Search (DC10) will find 1d10 silver & 1d4 gold pieces.\n\n5-KITCHEN : This room is obviously the kitchen. Cupboards line the north and east walls with countertops right beneath them. An oven and firepit take up the west wall. A small wooden table with two wooden chairs are pushed up against the middle of the south wall. A slightly ajar door shows a small pantry with shelves from floor to ceiling. A window overlooks a back alley.\n\tThe pantry closet has no more room to hold anything. It is fully stocked with jars and cans of food. About seven days of this could be used as trail rations if need be. A dual-candle holder can be found in the center of the table along with one on the countertop.\n\tA concealed trap door hides a circular stairway which leads to the basement; DC 20 to locate.\n\n6-UPSTAIRS HALLWAY : Protected by a Magic Mouth at threshold to hallway proper as marked on map. The Mouth's trigger is if anyone passes without a brooch that Barok and his right hand men (Brollun & Roop) wear. There are more brooches, but they are locked in a chest in Barok's office in the basement. If the Mouth is triggered, the 2 guards who roam the offices and the guards from the warehouse will be alerted and will come to investigate. If the PC's have been invited, Barok won't lead them down the hallway. He will try and stop them from entering the hallway. If they do, then he'll have the Magic Mouth reset within 2 days. He will only call the guards and attack if they try and enter any of the rooms that exit off the hallway.\n\n7-UNUSED ROOM : The room is unused, proved by the fact it has paint chipping and peeling away from the walls, and has a good layer of dust covering all of the surfaces.\n\tA search reveals nothing of value. Some small broken pieces of furniture is all that remains, and a cracked wooden picture frame.\n\n8-BAROK TRIZZLE'S BEDROOM : A rather sparsely furnished and decorated bedroom. A double sized bed is in the middle of the north wall with a small wooden night table beside it. A four drawer wooden dresser is against the east wall and a small wooden table with two chairs is against the south wall near where you enter. A small chest lies on the dresser which is padlocked. Several candle holders with partially used candles are placed on the night table, dresser, and small table.\n\tThis bedroom door is locked at all times. Barok Trizzle carries the key. Good wooden door ; DC 18 to burst, 25 to pick / Hrd 5pts hp 15. Bashing the door will alert the two guards who roam at night and they will call other guards before they go to investigate; 3-6 rounds. Bashing this door during the day will bring trouble within 1-2 rounds. Any sleeping occupants up here will be awakened as well.\n\tThe small chest is trapped and locked. DC 24 to burst lock, 25 to pick OR DC 17 to burst small chest / Small chest Hrd 5 hp 1 OR average lock Hrd 15 hp 30. Poison needle Greenblood Oil-Injury DC 13, Initial Dmg -1 Con, Secondary Dmg -1d2 Con.\n\tInside the chest : Potion of Jump, two (2) Potions of Cure Light Wounds, a large belt pouch containing 84sp, 22gp, and a small blue quartz worth 16gp, & two (2) bottles of valuable red wine worth 10gp each.\n\tA search of the dresser and night table reveals nothing of value or interest. Several clothing kits (phb, page 108) are available, along with other basic living items.\n\tAfter 8pm, Barok will be here only 35% of the time, and most likely sleeping unless the alarm has been raised.\n\tAfter 12am, Barok will be here 90% of the time, and will be sleeping.\n\tIf Barok is NOT in the bedroom, then he is automatically in his office in the basement. Maybe even asleep.\n\n9-BROLLUN'S BEDROOM : This bedroom is sparesly furnished with almost no decorations. Just a few candle holders on the dresser and night table. The bed is placed in the center of the west wall and is unmade. A small table with two chairs is just to the left of the door. Some clothes lay on the table and one chair.\n\tThis door is locked at all times. Brollun and Barok have keys. Good wooden door; DC 18 to burst, 25 to pick / Hrd 5 hp 15. Bashing the door will alert the two guards who roam at nighttime and they will call other guards before they go to investigate; 3-6 rounds. Any sleeping occupants up here will be awakened as well.\n\tA search will reveal some loose coins in the night table drawer; 22sp 8gp. Nothing else of value or interest is here. At night, Brollun has a 70% chance of being here, or else he is either working late in the warehouse or partying in the city.\n\n10-ROOP's BEDROOM : This bedroom is sparesely furnished. Just a few candle holders on the dresser and night table, and painted picture of a sunset and a valley over the center of the bed. The bed lies in the middle of the west wall. A small table and two chairs are just to the right of the entrance. The bed is unmade. A strong scent of sweet musk permeates this room.A change of clothes lie on the bed and a bunch of clothes is piled up in the southwest corner. A half drank bottle of fine red wine is left unstoppered on the table, along with two goblets.\n\tThis door is locked at all times. Roop and Barok have keys. Good wooden door; DC 18 to burst, 25 to pick / Hrd 5 hp 15. Bashing the door will alert the two guards who roam at nighttime and they will call other guards before they go to investigate; 3-6 rounds. Any sleeping occupants up here will be awakened as well.\n\tA search will reveal some loose coins in the top left dresser drawer; 12sp 2gp. A bottle of sweet musk cologne and several panty and garters will be found in the night table drawer. Other personal effects will also be found, including, but not limited to soap, change of clothes, & backpack.\n\tAfter 8pm, Roop will be here just 10% of the time.\n\tAfter 12am, Roop will be here just 50% of the time. Otherwise, he is 25% working late in warehouse or with Barok, or 75% in the city carousing and flirting with the women. He prefers them young and saves souveniers of his exploits.\n\n11-BASEMENT ENTRANCE : This square room contains a metal circular staircase going up to a trapdoor above. A latch deadbolt can be seen. This room is quite barren with old wooden shelves running the perimeter, three shelves in total at the 2', 4' and 6' heights. Some old looking boxes and supplies adorn the shelves. Two torch sconces are located at base of stairs and next to the door.\n\tThis door is always locked. Only Barok has a key. Good wooden door; DC 19 to burst, 26 to pick / Hrd 5 hp 17. Bashing the door will 85% alert the two guards who roam at night and they will call other guards before they go to investigate; 3-6 rounds.\n\tNothing of value or interest can be found. \n\n12-SUPPLY ROOM : The only thing of interest is a large stone archway in the center of the west wall. Two torch sconces are placed on either side of the stone archway.The small square room also contains some old broken furniture, a desk, some chairs, a couch. Bits of broken glass have been brushed into the southeast corner. Cobwebs are thick in every corner.\n\tA search (DC 19) of the broken pile of furniture will turn up a magical Punching Dagger +1 in a concealed compartment in a drawer from the broken desk.\n\tA hidden portcullis trap (DC 25) can be dropped between areas 12 & 13.\n\t\n13-BAROK TRIZZLE'S OFFICE : This 15' x 15'  square room appears to be quite lived in. A large oak desk is placed in the middle of the west wall with a leather bound wooden chair behind it. Two large shelves are against the north wall. Books, paperwork, and supplies are easily seen. A mug, a small pile of paper, two candle holders along with some other office supplies lie on the desk. An armoire is against the south wall. A large lantern is chained up to the ceiling in the center of the room.\n\tDuring the day, Barok will be here 20% of the time\n\tAfter 8pm, Barok is here 65% of the time - Possibly holding a meeting with Brollun (30%) & Roop (75%).\n\tAfter 12am, Barok is here 10% of the time - Possibly holding a meeting with Brollun (30%) & Roop (25%).\n\tThe armoire contains extra oil flasks for the ceiling lantern, a dozen jagged-sword brooches that is the symbol for Spry Enterprises, and Spry Entreprises' safe. \n\tThe safe is bolted to the stone wall and weighs 100lbs. (DC 26 to burst from wall-Hrd 10 hp 10). The safe is also trapped with Poison needle Greenblood Oil-Injury DC 13, Initial Dmg -1 Con, Secondary Dmg -1d2 Con. The safe lock could be Burst (DC 26) or pick (DC 26). Inside the safe; 3,680sp / 165gp / 4 quills / 10 bottles of ink / a seal of Coster Y / two (2) jars of red wax.\n\tThe shelves contain nothing but mundane office supples, mostly paper, several boxes of ink bottles and quills, candles, and Spry Enterprises ledger and business papers for the last 4-5 months. \n\tBarok's desk itself is littered with work papers and such. A quick search (DC 10), will reveal several pieces of parchment with failed forgery attempts. This was Barok's original attempts at duplicating the Coster Y seal and Trellick's writing and signature. The note contents just about duplicates the original letter the PC's found on the road ambush coming to Baldur's Gate.\n\tA secret door is located in the south wall closest to the west wall (DC 22).\n\n\t\n14-SECRET ROOM : If PC's entered through catacombs read the following After breaking away the weak wall you peer through and see a long rectangular stone room, apparently the secret room in the basement at Spry Enterprises. Four closed holding cells line the north wall, but they hold no prisoners. A good bit of dust covers everything. Manacles are attached to the south wall, four pairs in total. A rack, a known instrument of torture, is in the middle of the room. A small forge is against the west wall. This room hasn't been disturbed in years.\n\tIf PC's entered through Barok's office read the following instead You see a long rectangular stone room, apparently the secret room in the basement at Spry Enterprises. Four closed holding cells line the north wall, but they hold no prisoners. A good bit of dust covers everything. Manacles are attached to the south wall, 4 pairs in total. A rack, a known instrument of torture, is in the middle of the room. A small forge is against the west wall. This room hasn't been disturbed in years.\t\n\tA secret door is located in the north wall, closest to the west wall (DC 20). It is easier to see on this side.\n\tNOTE : Unless the PC's used magical silence when breaking through the wall when exiting the catacombs, Spry Enterprises could be alerted. Use the following table :\n\t\n\t6am-8pm : 20% Barok is in his office. He will bring Brollun & Roop and six (6) guards and will wait for PC's to come through secret door into his office. He will stand on other side of archway and will lower the portcullis.\n\t8pm-12am : 65% Barok is in his office and possibly with Brollun & Roop. He will keep Brollun & Roop here, while he goes to get six (6) guards. They will wait for PC's to come through secret door into his office. Barok will stand on other side of archway and will lower the portcullis.\n\t12am-2am : 10% Barok is in his office and possibly with Brollun & Roop. He will keep Brollun & Roop here, while he goes to get six (6) guards. They will wait for PC's to come through secret door into his office. Barok will stand on other side of archway and will lower the portcullis.\n\t2am-6am : 10% chance that someone will hear something from the 1st floor. They will fetch Brollun, Roop, Barok, who will then subsequently bring six (6) guards within 4-6 rounds.\n\tNOTE : If NO ONE is present in Barok's office during these hours, then use the base 10% chance from the 2am-6am slot.\n\n15-WAREHOUSE 1st FLOOR : This is a large warehouse, but without much content. A ramp in the center of the warehouse leads up to the 2nd floor. Mostly of the shelves that line the warehouse like streets and intersections, are empty. You do see an assortment of unopened crates, barrels, and other containers near the front lift gate. Some basic warehouse equipment is also visible, such as wheel ladders, wheelbarrels, tools, and a dolly or two. It is quite obvious this company is just starting out.A covered wagon is parked near the front as well.\n\tAbout 3,000gp of value can be totalled out of this warehouse, in goods & foods, and some better equipment as well.\n\tThere is usually twenty workers here during the day, minus that if they are in the recreation room, or getting equipment. Twelve of these will bear arms and fight if necessary.\n\n16-WAREHOUSE 2nd FLOOR : The 2nd floor of this warehouse is in decrepit shape and is not in use. Some squeeking can be heard. Four doors lead into offices at the north end, but these look unused as well. The glass window looking into one office is spidered with cracks.\n\tNothing of interest can be found here.\n\n\n\t\tRUNNING THE CONFLICT AT SPRY ENTERPRISES\n\n\tNo matter which way the PC's get in to search Spry Enterprises, there is a chance of an alert and attack. The most climatic result will be if the PC's make noise breaking the wall in the basement alerting Barok or someone else that something is amiss.\n\tA frontal assault or basement meeting will only get six (6) guards along with Brollun & Roop to attack the PCs. Barok and all his other lackey's will try to make an immediate escape, dropping the portcullis (if in basement), blocking the trap door in kitchen, and then setting the warehouse and office building ablaze using oil (thus making any treasure to be found upstairs unsalvagable). He will then escape in his wagon heading back to Elturel and his bandit HQs.\n\tThe PC's may retreat through broken wall and into the catacombs, but they will be pursued relentlessly.\n\tThe PC's may want to use subdual damage in this fight. Info is a high commodity and the ONLY way they will learn of the assassination attempt against Trellick Amaze via food poisoning. The PC's can use Bluff, Intimidation, or any other negotiation tactic they like. (DC is usually 10+HD of opponent; should be between 11-15 with circumstancial modifiers if needed).\n\tA folded up note will be found in Roop's beltpouch (if captured or killed), which reads 'I will be arriving shortly. You have recieved payment. Make sure to secure the right people. Do not use our own or anyone who could implicate us if captured. Your choice of where to initiate the ambush.' signed by Barok Trizzle. This note was the order by Barok to Roop & Brollun to carry out road ambush as planned, using forged Coster Y papers.\n\t\n\tINFO to be learned via interrogation :\n\t\n\tDC15 \"Barok forged the note\" - Only Roop & Brollun know this\n\tDC14 \"This was all Barok's planning. We only hired the ruffians under the pretense we were with Coster Y\" - Only Roop & Brollun know this\n\tDC14 \"I planted the note after the ambush. Right under your noses.\" - Only Roop & Brollun know this\n\tDC11 \"I work for Barok as a guard and warehouse worker. I really don't know much. Please don't kill me. Roop & Brollun were his right hand men.\" - Spoken only by regular guardsmen\n\tDC15 \"I overheard something about an assassination attempt. I think they have someone there now.\" - Spoken only by regular guardsmen.\n\tDC18 \"You're too late! Trellick will be dead within the hour and Spry will be back in business in no time! His next meal will be his last!\" - Spoken by either Roop or Brollun.\n\n\tNOTE-It is imperative that Barok escapes. The PC's should NOT be able to kill or capture him. Do your best!\n\n-Guards @ Spry Enterprises (12+)-Sirrab, Eriw, Raccam, Hicvecab, Nosnah, Xerom, Romem, Memor, Llexam, Regnessem, Lotot, Ginknab, male human Ftr1 : CR 1; Size M (5 ft., 11 in. tall); HD 1d10; hp 10; Init +6 (+2 Dex, +4 Improved initiative); Spd 20 ft.(-10 chainmail); AC 18 (+2 Dex, +4 chainmail, +2 large wooden shield); Attack +3 melee, or +3 ranged; SV Fort +2, Ref +2, Will -1; AL LE; Str 14, Dex 14, Con 11, Int 13, Wis 9, Cha 8.\n\nLanguages Spoken: Abyssal, Common.\n\nSkills and feats: Alchemy +2, Craft +5, Hide +2, Jump +6, Listen +0, Move silently +2, Spot -1, Swim +6; Combat reflexes, Improved initiative, Power attack.\n\nPossessions: Chainmail, large wooden shield, longsword, punching dagger, 2d10+4gp, 8d10+2sp\n\n\n\n\t\tCATACOMBS\n\tThese so-called catacombs, which the PC's are directed to via a sewer map, is actually an old evil wizard's hideout, that he created with help from magic and constructs.\n\n\tAfter digging away a good bit of fallen debris and rubble, and opening the concealed door, you see a sloping rough-hewn passage heading down and out of sight. A fine layer of dust covers the ground.\n\n1-SENTRY ROOM : You've reached a circular room, about 30' in diameter, with walls almost as smooth and shiny as marble. A huge change from the original passage you traversed. Four carved sarcophogi are embedded into walls, two on each side, and each just adjacent to an entrance or exit. Stairs rise up on the far side of the room, directly opposite where you entered.\n\tAn old magical trap still resides here (Search DC 25, Disable 25). If anyone enters the room, they must utter the name of the wizard who built this area. His name is Lrokrai. Ofcourse, none of the PC's will have any knowledge of this (a history DC 27 reveals history of this location and name of wizard). If his name is not uttered, then the four embedded sarcophogi crack down the middle, from top to bottom, and then open, using a full round action.\n\tOut comes four (4) enhanced skeletons. They will pursue any PC as long as they remain within the boundaries of the wizards area, including the magical stairs that go up to the landing.\n\n-Skeletons, Large (4) : CR 1; Size Large; HD 2d12; hp 22; Init +5 (+1 dex, +4 Improved Iniative); Spd 40ft.; AC 16 (-1 size, +1 dex, +3 natural, +3 pieces and bits of broken banded mail); Attacks 2 claws +2 melee; Damage Claw 1d6+2; SQ Undead, Immunities; SV Fort +0, Ref +1, Will +3; AL Neutral; Str 14, Dex 12, Con -, Int -, Wis 10, Cha 11\n\nSkills and Feats : Improved Iniative\n\n\n2-LROKRAI'S LABORATORY : You have gained access to what was once a laboratory. Two pillars rise from floor to ceiling near the middle of each long wall. Four long wooden tables, two of which have been tipped over and broken, take up a good portion of the middle of this room. Glass vials, flasks, chemistry equipment lie everywhere, about half of it broken and strewn amongst the dust covering the floor. An explosion must have taken place in this room. A large stained black mark takes up a good portion of the south and east walls, and likely the dusty floor as well. Some old wooden shelves are still intact, some are broken, with it's glass and fragile contents broken everywhere. A large hole in the ceiling exits the room in the northeast corner.\n\tA search will find a variety of items. Use the following list :\n\tDC 10 : Potion of Spider Climb & a bag with 55gp 3pp\n\tDC 12 : Potion of Delay Poison & a 100gp Amber gem\n\tDC 15 : Potion of Cats Grace & a small hole (large coin sized) that tapers to a point about 1 1/2\" into the east wall nearest the hole (where the magical stairs materilize)\n\tDC 20 (in a loose compartment in floor) : A masterwork Light Crossbow & (20) masterwork bolts\n\t\n\tPC's may want to take 20 in this room. In that case, they find everything.\n\n\tThe hole in the ceiling in this room contains an invisible incorporal circular staircase that rises to a landing about 80' above. Climbing this tunnel is very hard (DC 25 due to magical slipperiness).\n\tThe PC's will need Lrokrai's Key-Gem to activate the staircase, thus making it corporal and visible. Once activated, the stairs will remain visible and corporal for 10 minutes, after which it becomes invisible and incorporal once again. The Key-Gem will be ejected onto floor when this happens. The PC's should bring this with them!\n\n3-LROKRAI'S LIBRARY : This small square room is an old library, with bookshelves lining the west, north, and east walls. An archway leads into a small 10' tunnel heading to what looks like a bedroom or private suite. A good amount of dust covers everything, including two old leather bound chairs paired together, but seperated by a small round table along the south wall. A wooden step ladder is here as well.\n\tContrary to the Mage/Sorceror's delight, this library holds very little in the way of magic. A good amount of sorcery, necromancy, and demonic volumes line the shelves. All are mundane works, and some is just local history and other studies like math, physics, and other scientific stuff.\n\t\n\tA search will find (DC 15) the following :\n\t(1) Arcane scroll (5th level) in a jade tube with Summon Monster I & Mage Armor\n\t(1) Arcane scroll (5th level) in a ivory tube with Identify, Shadow Spray, & Snilloc's Snowball Swarm\n\t(1) Divine scroll (3rd level) in a wooden tube with symbols of the evil god Shar on it : Bless (x2), Sanctuary, & Faerie Fire\n\n\tTaking 20 will find all 3 items.\n\n4-LROKRAI'S BEDROOM : The arched tunnel leads into a very dusty large bedroom/suite. The far section of the room is sectioned off with extended folding decorative walls. Draperies in silk and other fine garments adorn the walls and ceiling of this chamber. A lavish poster bed with fine see through silk draperies is in the middle of the room, with the foot of it closest to you. Plush pillows adorn the bed as well as portions of the floor closest to the north eastern section of the room. A large oak dresser, armoire, and two night tables take up a good portion of the remaining space. Wall sconces line this room every 10', containing unused torches.\n\tThe sectioned off area contains a 10' x 10' sunken white, blue, & green tiled tub with no liquid in it. The water has long since dissapated. The tub is magical and cannot be moved. It gives off a faint aura. Upon command the tub can create water (\"Fill Tub\") and heat the water (\"Warm Water\").\n\tThe unused torches also are magical, giving off a faint aura. Upon command the torches can light and unlight (\"Light\" \"Darken\")\n\tThe fine tapestries and garments can be collected. They value about 500gp, but weigh 40lbs.\n\tIf anything is opened (armoire, dresser, night tables) a hidden guardian will attack the PC's (DC 26). An Air Mephit is hiding under the bed. His 1st round of action will be to summon another of it's type @ 25% success, hopefully during a surprise round.\n\tNOTE***If combat is too easy for PC's, strengthen the battle by adding a Dust Mephit (who can also try and summon another of it's type).\n\n\tThe Armoire is trapped (DC 25 to locate/DC27 to disable) and locked (DC 18 to pick/DC 13 to burst). The trap will go off if the armoire is touched without speaking the command word \"Safety\". The trap will cast Blindness (Fortitude Save DC 18 to avoid) & a Mental Alarm for Lrokrai on whoever touches the Armoire. The trap remains set after casting. Lrokrai is long dead and cannot respond to the mental alarm.\n\tNOTE***You can enhance the trap by making it cast Blindness in a 5' radius.\n\tThe armoire contains : small box with 30pp 500gp, 100gp Waterstar (tourmaline), small 100gp piece of Angelar's Skin (Fine pink coral), & 200gp Laeral Tear (small colorless, soft, crystalline, brittle stones named for the famous sorceror Laerel) / 3 flasks of unholy water / ring box containing Ring Of Protection +1 / A diamond shaped gem which is the Gem Key for the staircase.\n\n-Air Mephit : CR 3; Size Small; HD 3d8; hp 21; Init +7 (+3 dex, +4 Improved Iniative); Spd 30ft., 60ft (perfect); AC 17 (+1 size, +3 dex, +3 natural); Attacks 2 claws +4 melee; Damage Claw 1d3; SA Breath Weapon, spell-like abilities, summon mephit; SQ Fast Healing 2, Damage Reduction 5/+1; SV Fort +3, Ref +6, Will +3; AL Neutral; Str 10, Dex 17, Con 10, Int 12, Wis 11, Cha 15\n\nSkills and Feats : Bluff +6, Hide +12, Listen +6, Move Silently +9, Spot +6; Improved Iniative\n\n-Dust Mephit (if needed) : CR 3; Size Small; HD 3d8; hp 20; Init +7 (+3 dex, +4 Improved Iniative); Spd 30ft., Fly 50ft.

The room is as dusty as any of the others you have discovered thus far and empty.\n\tA search (DC 15) will reveal a similar hole like what was found at the bottom of the stairs. The gem (if taken), can be used to activate the stairs (see room 2 above) from up here too.\n\tA search (DC 22) will find a secret door on the north wall. It will reveal a short 2' passageway through rough hewn rock that ends in a brick & mortar wall. There was once two secret doors seperating this 2' passageway, but new tenants who took residence in this building tore down the 2nd secret door and sealed it off.\n\tThe PC's will have to break down the wall (hopefully silently or Spry Enterprises could be alerted); wall Hardness 8, hp 75 or DC 35 to burst.\n\tOnce broken through, the PC's will have entered Spry Enterprises secret basement room adjacent to room 13 (Barok's office). Refer to Room 13 to find out how to determine if Spry is on the alert.\n\n\n\t\tSAVING TRELLICK AMAZE\n\tThe PC's should have discovered the assassination attempt against Trizzle Amaze via poison in his food at next meal. Try to time this for a climatic rescue, with the PC's barely making it into Trizzle's room with fork in hand! \n\tThe PC's will be 2500ft away. That means a PC with about 20 Con can make it without any Con checks. More than likely, only one or two PC's will make into the room where Trellick is eating. NOTE***PC's can run (4x speed) a number of rounds equal to their Con. After that, the PC will need to make a DC10 Con check (-1 penalty each round thereafter) or will have to rest for 10 rounds (1min).\n\tIf the PC's are NOT in time, Trellick will be affected with Dark Reaver Powder (Ingested DC 18, 2D6 Con initial damage, then 1d6 Con + 1d6 Str damage). Trellick could very well die of this attack.\n\tThe Assassin will not be found, but the dead cook will be. His body can be found in a closet off the kitchen, choked to death, and then stabbed through the heart.\n\tTrellick will have this to say to the PC's \"You all have done very well! Bravo! This proves my suspicions about Spry Enterprises. I thank you very much for saving my life and for that I am forever indebted to you all. You be rewarded as well, but lets talk about what has transpired.\".\n\tLet the PC's and Trellick talk and roleplay for a bit.\n\tTrellick will then tell the PC's this \"I wish to hire you on again. Abyl has given me some information about who these hoodlums are. Apparently her sources have discovered they are a new guild operating out of Elturel, to the east. Investigate this new guild to make sure Abyl's sources are correct. I'm not that cold-blooded to kill them outright. You do have my permission to stop them if need be. Use lethal force as a last chance option. I will send message to Abyl about the delay for you, and on top of that, you will be compensated once again upon success. Success which I'm sure you will achieve! Now let's feast and discover the sins of the flesh.\".\n\tTrellick invites PC's to enjoy themselves in a large feast, with plenty of fine wine, mead, dwarven ale, to go around. To top it off, he has dancers and showgirls who will be more than agreeable to a night with any of the PCs.\n\tIf Trellick is NOT saved and dies from the poison, Prestice will step forward to ask PC's to wreak revenge against Barok. He will say all the above text, except the part about the PC's having done well. The PC's should be penalized if Trellick dies with less Experience points.\n\n\tNOTE *** If Trellick dies from poisoning, his youngest son, Bruno Amaze will take over the business. Bruno is a young and sordid character. He cares more about conquesting girls, drinking, and carousing. Trellick has three sons, but the oldest was an adventurer and was killed during an adventure. The middle son also wants to adventure, but is currently working in Athkatla, handling business for his father. The final assault by Barok will instead be made against Bruno.\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tCHAPTER II\n\n\t\tCROSS COUNTRY TO ELTUREL\n\tThe trek to Elturel will pass from a hard cobblestone roadway for a few days out of Baldurs Gate, to hard packed dirt road the rest of the way to Elturel. The Journey is 230 miles long; give or take 5 miles. The PC's will pass about 8 or so hamlets, villages, or roadway Inns along the way. None should be of note, unless listed below.\n\n\tOn foot : 9 1/2 days to reach Elturel ***24 miles per day\n\tOn horseback : 7 1/4 days to reach Elturel ***32 miles per day\n\n\tA day-by-day schedule is listed below to save the time of having to roll for wilderness random encounters :\n\nDAYS 1-2 : No encounters\n\nDAY 3 : A fork in the road has several tall wooden signs. One sign points to the north and has written on it 'To Daggerford & Waterdeep 635miles' & the other sign points to the east and has written on it 'To Elturel 232miles' 'To Soubar 247miles' 'To Triel 286miles' & 'To Scornubel 311miles'. A small caravan is approaching from the east.\n\tThe caravan is a merchant caravan from Scornubel heading to Baldurs Gate. 4 commoners, 4 guardsmen, & 1 expert merchant are present along with 2 uncovered wagons. They have about 2000gp worth of goods that are listed in the PHB. None are for sale, but they might be 'talked' into selling something.\n\tThey have following info for free :\n\t\"There is talk of recent bandits closer towards Elturel, but we passed safely. Maybe we were just lucky.\" (true)\n\t\"This uprising of bandits hasn't really slowed down the merchant trade.\" (semi-true)\n\t\"Elturel officials do want the Bandits stopped. Maybe you should talk to the officials there.\" (true)\n\t\"Rumor suggests these bandits are crossbreeds of humans and orcs\" (false)\n\t\"High Rider Dhelt is a madman bent on policing every issue in Elturel. You do something wrong there, and you could be put away for a very long time. Maybe never to be seen again.\" (true)\n\nDAYS 4-7 : No encounters. Day 6 has a heat wave raising normal temperature by 10 degrees. On Day 7, there is a medium rainstorm that lasts 11 hours, starting at 8am.\n\nDAY 8 (evening during sleep) : A pack of wild wolves will approach the PC's camp seeking food, smelling them from afar. The PC's can avoid a fight and possibly move on, but ONLY if they have fresh meat to leave for the wolves. Trail rations will NOT work. There is still a chance the wolves will follow the PC's by scent, assuming there could be more food.\n\tA pack of seven (7) wolves will attack PC's unless given food. NOTE***Add or subtract 1-2 wolves if combat is too hard or too easy.\n\tUse their Feat to Trip to good effect.\n\n-Wolves (7) : CR 1; Size Medium; HD 2d8+4; hp 13-18; Init +2 (dex); Spd 50ft.; AC 14 (+2 dex, +2 natural); Attacks Bite +3 melee; Damage Bite 1d6+1; SA Trip; SQ Scent; SV Fort +5, Ref +5, Will +5; AL Neutral; Str 13, Dex 15, Con 15, Int 2, Wis 12, Cha 6\n\nSkills and Feats : Hide +3, Listen +6, Move Silently +4, Spot +4, Wilderness Lore 1 (+5 when tracking by scent); Weapon Finesse (bite)\n\n\nDAY 9 (NOTE-Before PC's get into Elturel) : The sounds of combat and cries for help comes from just ahead of you. The hard-packed dirt roadway is on a rise, so you'll need to get over the crest of this hill before anything can be seen.\n\tThe PC's have come across Barok's bandits attacking a noble family traveling from Soubar to Elturel. The two bodyguards will already be wounded (half hp), and the noble man & woman are cowering near the covered wagon. Upon seeing the PC's, they will request help immediately, in the name of Gond!\n\tA total of 6 bandits are attacking.\n\n-Bandits, Roadway Ambush (6), Benner, Stevo, Markis, Herry, Sedeare, Kasmo, Human Ftr1 : CR 1; Size M; HD 1d10; hp 13; Init +1 (+1 Dex); Spd 30 ft.; AC 11 (+1 Dex); Attack +3 melee, or +2 ranged; SV Fort +2, Ref +1, Will -1; AL NE; Str 15, Dex 13, Con 10, Int 15, Wis 9, Cha 11.\n\nLanguages Spoken: Abyssal, Common, Orc.\n\nSkills and feats: Disguise +2, Forgery +3, Handle animal +4, Heal +1, Hide +3, Listen -1, Move silently +1, Spot -1, Wilderness lore +0; Combat reflexes, Dodge, Toughness.\n\nPossessions: Chainmail, large wooden shield, battleaxe, punching dagger, 6d10+5gp, 1d100+40sp\n\n\t\n\tIf any of the bandits are taken alive, the following information can be learned, if successful Intimidation (or Bluff) rolls are made :\n\tDC 15 : \"We/I are part of a bandit group led by Barok Trizzle. He will run you through! He will run me through! Please don't let him learn I gave you this info.\"\n\tDC 20 : \"The Bandit headquarters is about several miles northwest of Elturel, in an old abandoned small fort. You can forget about going there, you will be killed on sight!\"\n\tDC 22 : \"Some of the higher ups, wear special cloaks when going into the city. I think they belong to a special group there.\".\n\tThe PC's may want to go directly to the Bandit's Lair first. If so, any captured bandits will steadfastly refuse to lead them there. Any left will attempt escape or grab a weapon and fight to the death. ***ONLY a successful Intimidation/Bluff DC 27 will get a bandit to lead them to the lair.\n\n\tThe nobles will offer each PC a turqoise gem worth 20gp as a reward for their rescue. (You can possibly use the nobleman in a future adventure with him maybe needing help with something).\n\n\nDAY 9 1/2 : You have reached your destination. The city of Elturel lies just below you in the Chionthar Valley. The Chionthar river runs adjacent to Elturel on its southern most side, but high cliffs keep the waters from reaching the walled segment of the city. The walled part of the city sits atop cliffs, with roads winding their way down to the flat shores of the river itself. You see barges and cargo ships docked at piers, and much activity on the docks and river itself. This city is smack in the middle of major trade routes that lead to Scornubel, Soubar, Baldurs Gate, and further east. The city's ruler, High Rider Lord Dhelt, is known for having the best policed city in the Western Heartlands.\n\tThe PC's will have to pay 1cp each for Gate Toll.\n\n\n\t\tINTRIGUE IN ELTUREL\n\tLet the PC's catch some R&R. Peasants, guards, or whomever can direct the group to several tap rooms and Inn's near the gate where they enter. They will directed to possibly the nicest Inn in Elturel, called the Chionthar Valley Inn, which practically hangs over a cliff overlooking the Chionthar River below. The Inn has thick wooden and stone supports which keeps it from falling down to the river. They can be told \"The views are magnificent and the sunsets/sunrises even better.\".\n\tThe PC's will soon ask or search around for the guild that Barok Trizzle is associated with. It is a mercenary Guild, with about 30 members (all fighters & rangers), not including Barok's right hand man here in Elturel, named Derrton Capono (3rd level Ranger). Derrton is currently at the Bandit's Lair (and will accompany Barok to Baldurs Gate for the final assault) making preparations and getting things ready for the attack against Coster Y in Baldurs Gate, having learned the news of the assassination attempt.\n\tThe best way for the PC's go find out where the guild is, is to ask around (Gather Information DC 12 1d6 hour task depending on where they go and who they ask). With Elturel maintained and policed so well, a thriving Rogue's Guild is NOT present, although one does barely exist in secrecy (in case the PC's want to contact one).\n\tUnlike Baldurs Gate, there is no secret way into Barok's Mercenary Guild. Upon finding its location, the PC's can start planning on how to gain access. Unknown to the PC's, only a skeleton crew remains.\n\n\n\tBAROK'S MERCENARY GUILD\n\tRead the following to the PC's upon sighting of the Guild Hall : You have apparently found Barok's Mercenary Guild. A sign decked out in royal blue with gold lettering is hung over the ornate double wooden doors which sit atop a stone stairway that rises about 20' above street level. Even the stairs themselves are somewhat remarkable, as they are watched over by two stone statues of warriors at the base of the stairway. The pose of each warrior is such that they seem ready for battle. Black iron railings, designed with the shape of swords throughout, also adorn this staircase.\n\tThis building used to be used as a festhall, usually for celebrations for the city, or local nobles. After the High Rider Lord Dhelt dedicated a new building for such occasions, this building was sold to the highest bidder. Barok purchased this building and began converting it to a training grounds for fighter types. On another note, Barok is also dealing in slavery. He has a small stockade in the basement of this building and has been selling theses slaves to the owner of the neighboring Coliseum, a fellow by the name of Jazol Bilotomo. This business partnership has been going on for about the last 10 months. Jazol trains and recruits his own mercenaries for Coliseum fighting, along with prisoners who are to be put to death by fighting, but the oppurtunity to purchase slaves couldn't be passed over. They train easy and are promised freedom with a certain number of wins. Ofcourse, getting those wins is another story altogether...\n\n\tThe large thick wooden front doors are Hrd 5 Hp 40 DC20 pick DC28 burst. The doors will be closed and locked upon the PC's arrival. Maybe magic can get them in quickly??? Barok and any of the main henchmen have keys.\n\n-Guards (8)-Numi, Talocohc, Haltrum, Lasse, Hicae, Bulc, Esu, Muloc, male human Ftr1 : CR 1; Size M (5 ft., 2 in. tall); HD 1d10+2; hp 12; Init -1 (-1 Dex); Spd 30 ft.; AC 16 (-1 Dex, +5 chainmail, +2 large steel shield); Attack +2 melee, or +0 ranged; SV Fort +4, Ref -1, Will -3; AL LE; Str 12, Dex 9, Con 14, Int 9, Wis 4, Cha 11.\n\nLanguages Spoken: Common.\n\nSkills and feats: Alchemy +1, Handle animal +4, Hide -1, Listen -1, Move silently -1, Spot -1; Alertness, Blind-fight, Weapon focus (sword, short).\n\nPossessions: Chainmail, large steel shield, shortsword, punching dagger, 4d10gp, 1d100+35sp\n\n-Guards (4)-Becknik, Yeldir, Eelgna, Nevtos, male human Rgr1 : CR 1; Size M; HD 1d10-1; hp 9; Init +3 (+3 Dex); Spd 30 ft.; AC 13 (+3 Dex); Attack +3 melee, or +4 ranged, Two-weapon -1 (Scimitar)/-2 (shortsword); SV Fort +1, Ref +3, Will +1; AL LE; Str 14, Dex 17, Con 9, Int 9, Wis 12, Cha 12.\n\nLanguages Spoken: Common.\n\nSkills and feats: Animal empathy +5, Hide +3, Intuit direction +5, Knowledge (nature) +1, Listen +1, Move silently +3, Search +3, Spot +1, Use rope +5; Point blank shot, [Track], Weapon focus (scimitar).\n\nPossessions: Chainshirt, scimitar, shortsword, longbow, 25 arrows, 3d10+7gp, 1d100+22sp\n\n\n1-OUTER HALLWAY : This hallway is decorated with banners and mosaics of great battles, poses of fighters and heros, and other items detailing the life of a warrior. An 8' foot suit of armor stands just inside the thick ornate wooden doors. Barok's symbol is painted onto the helmet, shield, and breatplate of the suit-of-armor. The walls itself have been painted royal blue and gold.\n\tThe door leading to the stairway is locked (Hrd 5 hp 10 DC 18 pick, DC 15 burst). Any of the guards has the key.\n\tTwo (2) guards will always be present pacing the hallway. Upon seeing the PC's, they will raise the alarm. If the alarm is sounded, then two (2) more guards will arrive each round, for 5 straight rounds. There is only 12 guards in the building currently. The other 18 members are at the Bandit Lair, going over details of the raid against Coster Y in Baldurs Gate. Barok & Derrton Capano will also be at the Bandit Lair. Roop & Brollun will also be there (if they survived the fight back in Baldurs Gate).\n\n2-TRAINING AREA : This great room has been converted into a training facility, complete with sunken fighting arena. Free weights, jousting bags, and other training equipment can be seen all over. The vaulted ceiling gives this room an almost intimidating feel. Tapestries, banners, flags, trophies, all adorn this hall. Two large candelabras hang down from the ceiling. A nice assortment of weapons on weapon racks is against the far wall, along with large racks with hold different types of armors. The walls here have also been painted royal blue and gold. The gold is a border near head height and also as a border along the ceiling.\n\tEight (8) guards will be in this room if alarm has not been sounded. They are working out with the free weights, exercising, or jousting one another. They could easily be taken by surprise by a careful group of PCs who listen carefully before entering. The guards will use whatever weapons they can get off the racks.\n\tThere is atleast 1-4 types of each simple & martial weapon here along with the following armor : 2 leather armor, 2 studded leather, 2 chainshirts, 2 chainmail, & 2 scalemail. Weapons and armor can be sold at 50% of book value.\n\n3-RECREATION ROOM : Two long sofas, two comfortable chairs, and a large cocktail table is in this area. The room is adorned like the rest of the Guild, with banners and some tapestries in the motif of fighting depicting great battles and warriors. The walls have been painted royal blue with a thick gold stripe mid-way up off the floor.\n\tTwo (2) guards are here. They are talking and relaxing and can be easily caught off-guard. They will NOT be here if an alarm was raised.\n\tNothing of value can be found here.\n\n4-STORAGE ROOM : This square room has bare stone walls, unlike the rest of the guild and seems to be a large store room. Shelves line the walls and also the middle of the room forming several rows. Cleaning equipment, extra fighting gear, jars of paint, and many boxes are readily visible.\n\tThe simple wooden door is locked (Hrd 5 hp 10 DC 18 pick, DC 13 burst). Barok & all henchmen (Roop & Brollun if alive), have keys.\n\tA search (DC20) will find about 100gp worth of goods that can be sold for half that; several boxes of candles, 10ft ladder, several boxes of paper, 10ft pole, (2) 50ft hemp rope, sledge, (4) shovels/spades, several boxes of whetstones, Artisan's tools, & several different size lanterns.\n\n5-BAROK TRIZZLE'S OFFICE : This room is painted like all the others, with royal blue and a gold stripe as a border along the top of the wall. A large white oak desk and chair dominate this room. The room has a stone floor, but the center is taken up by a large brown bear rug complete with stuffed head. Several wooden cabinets are against the east wall. A lantern has been hung in the center of the ceiling. Two chairs are in front of the desk and two more just to the right and left of the door. Papers, ink wells, quills, and other office material is strewn about the desk. A large chest is against the north wall.\n\tThe good wooden door is locked at all times (Hrd 5 hp 12 DC25 pick DC 20 burst). Barok and any of the henchmen have keys (this includes keys that may have been found on Roop & Brollun if killed earlier).\n\tA search (DC20) will find the following :\n\tJournel entry papers detailing the investigation of certain old ruins outside of Elturel (this includes Granjis Fort). Make some names up or use the following : caves near some hills to the north of Elturel, forest Wood Of Sharp Teeth, some caves found west along the Chionthar River, & Marpis Tower further east past Elturel as possible locations to use as headquarters.\n\tA piece of crumpled paper that is written in disapearing ink (DC 20 to notice writing) says the following \"18 of our best. Myself, Roop, Brollun, & Derrton. That makes 22 total and should be plenty to succeed.\" Cross out Roop & Brollun's name if they were killed earlier. There is some doodles of other numbers which are possible attack dates. Put three consecutive #'s down depending on current date of your campaign. Example-If current date is June 17th, put the following \"24th, 25th, 26th???\". The attack by Barok and his men against Coster Y will take place in 8 days from the time the PC's read this letter. That will give them very little time to find the Fort and further proof of the attack (when exactly, where, and against who) and then head back to Baldurs Gate to help Trizzle Amaze. The PC's won't be able to make it back to Baldurs Gate in time without horses.\n\tThere is also a ledger with names and prices next to each one. The buyer is listed as Jazol Bilotomo (owner of Coliseum). The PC's won't have a clue who this for now. This is minor proof of slave activity.\n\t800gp, 2500sp, 5000cp will be found in a locked chest (Hrd 5 Hp15 DC23 Burst DC 26 pick) & trapped (DC 21 locate/disable) with Large Scorpion Venom (DC18 initial -1D6 Str/DC18 secondary -1D6 Str).\n\tA smaller box inside the chest contains Potion of Vision, Potion of Aid, large metal key (metal door in tunnel to Coliseum), & a bag with 5 gems (100gp amethyst, chrysoberyl, brown-green garnet, jet, & waterstar).\n\n\tA secret door can be found here (DC 22) that leads into a newly carved tunnel. This tunnel connects into the lower levels of the Coliseum. This tunnel is used to transport blind-folded slaves to Jazol.\n\n6-SLAVER STOCKADE : You see a long hallway about 60' long. Along the left side is metal bars and with a total of 6 metal doors spaced evenly. Stone walls seperate each cell. Manacles hang on pegs along the right side and a small desk and chair is just inside the doorway. A decent stench assails your noses.\n\tA-empty\n\tB-empty\n\tC-Contains 2 human males; named Maxl & Yorl ages 24 & 22. They were captured during a recent bandit raid. They know that they'll be sold off soon and request help. They know from over hearing the guards that there is a secret passageway out of this building.\n\tD-empty\n\tE-empty\n\tF-Contains a young human female; named Alli age 15. She wasn't purchased by Jazol and so instead has been repeatedly raped by several of the guards. She is overheard crying from her cell. She will barely speak, but her tattered clothes should tell the tale. She has this to say (DC20 Diplomacy) \"They took me through a tunnel sirs. Two large metal doors. They said something to the someone behind the 2nd door. I can't remember...but, maybe...yes...yes...they said \"war is best\". The 2nd door opened and I then heard a big argument. The man they tried to sell me to wasn't interested in me. Said he only needed ones who fight. Males.\".\n\tEach cell contains a wooden bench, a bucket for excrement, and loops attached to the back wall of each cell in case someone needs to be restrained.\n\n7-SECRET TUNNEL : This tunnel is made of rough hewn stone and leads into darkness. You follow the tunnel for about 90' and then it makes a 70 degree turn to the left. It then goes another 70' feet ending at a large metal door with a lock.\n\tIf the PC's have the key, they can use it to unlock door.\n\tLarge metal door (Hrd 10 Hp60 DC28 Burst DC 30 pick).\n\tRead the following after the first door is opened or broken : After getting the metal door open, you see another similar metal door just 10' further in. This door is showing no lock.\n\tLarge metal door (Hrd10 Hp60 DC28 Burst DC30 pick-Can only be picked from other side).\n\tThe PC's may bang on the door to get attention of Jazol's guards on other side. If they know the passcode \"War is best\", they will open the door.\n\tIf the PC's ask any questions, this will raise the guards suspicions. They will send for Jazol immediately. They will tell the PC's to wait here and not start any trouble. Go to section \"Meeting With Jazol\".\n\tIf the PC's start a fight, run combat normally, until the 4th round when Jazol arrives. He will ask for the fighting to stop. He is curious who it is who was able to beat Barok's defenses and get through the tunnel!\n\n-Guards @ Jazol's Coliseum (unnamed-too plentiful to count), Human Ftr2 : CR 2; Size M (6 ft., 1 in. tall); HD 2d10+2; hp 13; Init +4 (+4 Improved initiative); Spd 20 ft.(-10 halfplate); AC 19 (+7 halfplate, +2 large steel shield); Attack +6 melee (+1 masterwork axe/sword), or +2 ranged SV Fort +4, Ref +0, Will +0; AL LN; Str 16, Dex 11, Con 13, Int 12, Wis 11, Cha 11.\n\nLanguages Spoken: Common, Gnoll.\n\nSkills and feats: Craft +3, Hide +0, Jump +8, Knowledge (religion) +3.5, Listen +2, Move silently +0, Spellcraft +3, Spot +0; Exotic weapon proficiency (waraxe, dwarven), Improved initiative, Weapon focus (shortbow), Weapon focus (dwarven waraxe OR longsword).\n\nPossessions: Halfplate, large steel shield, masterwork dwarven waraxe OR masterwork longsword, punching dagger, 1d4 pp, 2d10+6gp, 1d100+45sp \n\n\n\t\tMEETING WITH JAZOL\n\tThe easiest way for the PC's to meet with Jazol is after getting through the tunnel, but also the most dangerous because a fight could break out.\n\tThe other method will be if the PC's couldn't breach the tunnel. They will need to deduce that the tunnel connects to the Coliseum. They can ask around to find out who owns or runs the Coliseum (Gather Info DC 12). The name will be the same from the ledgers that they found. They could enter the Coliseum through the main entrance and request a meeting with Jazol.\n\t\n\tJazol, a deep dwarf, will agree to see the PC's. Let the PC's confront him about the slaves and anything else they want to tell him. His response will be \"It has been a lucrative partnership so far, but I'm beginning to see the error of my ways. I don't want High Rider Dhelt to know of any of this. I am willing to help you out if you are willing to help me out. I will stop buying slaves and will avoid any further business involving slavers. Barok is a loose cannon. He has gotten worse and worse since I've known him. His lofty goals have made him quite manic.\".\n\tIf the PC's agree to keep quiet about the slavery, then Jazol will tell the PC's that Barok is behind the Banditry for sure and will also tell them he is using the ruined Granjis Fort north of Elturel. He will have two of his own guide the PC's to the fort.\n \n\n\t\tGRANJIS FORT\n\tIf research about Granjis Fort is done, give the PC's the following : (Using Knowledge Local or paying a sage in Elturel)\n\tDC 8 :Granjis Fort is named after the captain of Elturel some 50+ years ago. He was granted a promotion in rank and given the duties to maintain the Fort to help rid any monster or evil that could take place on the road between Elturel & Soubar. The Fort made a big difference in stopping almost all of the evil and ridding any bandits in the area. \n\tDC 12 : For 25 years Captain Granjis reigned and he was looking forward to the twilight of his life and retirement. Historians aren't exactly sure what happened in the 26th year of operation, but a quick sloppily written note left behind by the Captain tell of a loud roaring from below the Fort and shortly after 'all hell broke loose'. 'Fire and brimstone everywhere'. 'My Guards decimated in seconds'. 'Kelemvor Save Us'. \n\t\n\tRumor : Captain Granjis was mortally wounded and was seen being carried off by a slouching outsider. A demon (false)\n\tRumor : A portal is said to exist below the Fort. Demons come and go as they like.  (true/false)\n\tRumor : Several of Captain Granjis' soldiers survived. They spoke of creatures who spit lightning, fire, and acid. Creatures whose skin smoked. (false)\n\tRumor : No one survived. It was like a battle never took place. No bodies were found. Just bloodstains and scorch marks. (true)\n\n\tGranjis Fort is about a 2 hour walk along the north road heading out of Elturel. The PC's will be lead to a break in the road and onto an unused and overgrown smaller dirt road that leads to Granjis Fort. The fort itself has been concealed by all the growth and trees in the area and is about 200 yards off road and sits atop a small rise. The PC's will likely slowly and carefully approach the ruins. \n\tGranjis Fort is in ruins for sure. Crumbling walls show the interior courtyard from almost any angle. Four 25' towers can be seen along with a much taller fifth tower towards the rear. Small buildings, also in ruin, can be seen on the inside. A wide stone crumbling staircase rises up to meet the tall fifth tower. Two large wooden gates once kept out intruders, but now the right hand gate lies broken and useless on the ground, and the left gate hangs only by its highest hinge.

Stones, rubble, and wood lies everywhere. The stairs leading up to the big tower also is crumbling. The remnants of six small wooden buildings lie in tattered ruins just inside the gates on both sides. Archways and partial walls are the only remains giving away the fact that buildings existed inside this courtyard. Only the big tower and large double doors at its base remains in good shape. In fact, the doors look kind of new.\n\tIf an alarm is raised, the remaining bandits will come out led by Lorren Blackfoot call from the top tower (commander of Fort in absence of Barok & Derrton). This should be a great fight versus the PC's. Lorren is an experience Ranger and will use as good tactics against the PC's as possible. As long as Lorren is alive, no bandit will make a retreat. Lorren is Barok's girlfriend and will try to stay to the outskirts of the battle, commanding the archers to take down any spellcasters first. Lorren will target the weakest first  (those wearing little or no armor).\n\tA secret door (DC26) is against the side of the stairs closest to the tower and leads into a small area (Keyed Area 8-see below) under the stairs with a ladder going down 15'. This leads to the hidden basement containing a Realms portal.\n\n1-FESTHALL : If the alarm was NOT raised read the following : Opening the big double wooden doors reveals an old great fest hall. Old tattered banners and flags adorn the walls and ceiling along with a great wooden and metal chandelier. Two large long tables with chairs take up most of this room. A grand stone staircase rises up to the floor above. A similar great staircase leads down, running just beneath the staircase that rises to the second floor. Eight faces peer in your direction, obviously surprised by your appearance.\n\tIf the alarm WAS raised read the following : Opening the big double wooden doors reveals an old great fest hall. Old tattered banners and flags adorn the walls and ceiling along with a great wooden and metal chandelier. Two large long tables with chairs take up most of this room. A grand stone staircase rises up to the floor above, and behind the stairs going up, looks to be a similar staircase leading down.\n\tGive PC's a partial action each (if all PC's are aware of bandits inside-listen checks (DC10) easily reveal the bandits). After each action, roll iniative for the bandits. ***Bravo for the PC's on a successful stalk and enter!\n\tPapers and maps are strewn all over the back table. This is the plans detailing the attack against Trellick Amaze & Coster Y. A date reads (2pm on the 8th day from current date of your game). Trellick believes he will be having a business meeting with another Coster leader in a vacant warehouse near the east gates. Other papers detail the order and creation of masterwork swords, bows, and mightybows.\n\t\n\tIf any Bandit is taken alive information can be had using Intimidation checks (DC12 / Lorren DC 16) :\n\n\t\"Barok left about 36 hours ago, give or take a bit. You're too late!\"\n\t\"He has (Roop, Brollun if alive) Derrton and about 12 men with him. Trellick has no chance.\"\n\t\"Barok won't fail this time. Your meddling has stopped us here, but his goals aren't here anymore.\"\n\n\tBarok and his men left 36 hours ago! The PC's will have to march double-time to catch up! It takes about 7 1/4 days to reach Baldurs Gate. \t\n\tNOTE***Use the forced march rules in the PHB.pg143 to see if the PC's can get intercept Barok and his men OR can get to the meeting on time, OR not at all. Distance from Granjis Fort to Baldurs Gate is approximately 232miles.\n\n2 BARRACKS : A room that is being used as a barracks. Several bunkbeds are spaced evenly around this room. Two wooden footlockers lie at the foot of each bunk. The room is fairly clean. All the beds are made, although not to perfection.\n\tThe door to this room is never locked. No guards will be present in this room during the PC's attack. They are either guarding/scouting or relaxing and eating in the Festhall below.\n\tEach footlocker contains 2 sets of clean clothing, some personal hygiene items, and a small belt pouch. A total of 222sp 47gp can be found if every footlocker & pouch is searched.\n\n3-DERRTON'S BEDROOM : A bedroom of a outdoorsman for sure. Some stuffed deer heads lie propped against the walls of this room. A bed, dresser, night table, candles and holders are the contents of this room. Some clothes are neatly folded on the floor and the bed is made almost ot perfection.\n\tThis door is NOT locked. Derrton isn't expecting trouble, and everyone knows better than to steal from him.\n\tA search reveals a small bag containing : 6pp, 55gp, 110sp.\n\n4-LORREN'S BEDROOM : This is a bedroom sparsely furnished. A disheveled bed, dresser, night table, desk & chair are the contents of this room. Some old tattered banners of glorious battles adorn two walls.\n\tLorren keeps her own chambers locked at all times. Good wooden door (Hrd 5 Hp 15 Burst 16 Pick 21). Barok and herself have the only key.\n\tA search of the room will reveal : \n\tA small bag under some clothes in the dresser which contains six (6) gems : (3) 25gp Crowns of Silver & (3) 25gp Blue Quartz\n\tSome scattered coins in the top drawer of the night table : 44cp 37sp 8gp\n\tSeveral sets of feminine clothes, including a cloak, one pair of boots, two belts, and several small bottles of perfume.\n\n5-BAROK'S CHAMBERS : This room is seperated by a folding decorative partition, creating a sleeping area and office area. A large desk and chair take up the right side of the room, and a bed and dresser take up the other half. A small cabinet is next to the desk. A large chest is at the foot of the bed with its lid raised open.\n\tThis door is locked. Only Barok & Lorren have keys. Good wooden door (Hrd 5 Hp 15 Burst 16 Pick 21).\n\tNo incriminating evidence will be found here. Despite tons of paperwork in the cabinet and desk, most of it is the paperwork for the Mercenary Guild. One of the papers details further the type of weapons bought and from whom (a local blacksmith in Elturel).\n\tA search of the room reveals the following :\n\n\t(6) six bottles of black & blue ink\n\t(22) twenty two unused quills\n\tAn empty chest!\n\n\tA concealed safe is set into the stone wall (DC25 to locate). The safe is untrapped, but very hard to locate. The safe contains Barok's personal wealth to date, minus what he has spent for the attack against Coster Y. A large sack inside the safe contains 127sp 444gp.\n\n\t***A ladder in the hallway outside Barok's room leads up to the parapet roof. A closed hatch can be barred from the inside.\n\n6-DUNGEON/CELLS : The air here seems a bit humid, although the room is still at ground level. A stone well with wooden support sits just below the stairs. A table and two benches occupies the center of this circular chamber. Along the perimeter of the room are empty jail cells; nine of them in total. All the cells have bars seperating them, including the doors, all of which are closed and apparently locked.\n\tAll the cells have new locks on them and show recent use. (Hrd 10 Hp 60 Burst 28 Pick 24). All nine jail cell keys can be found hanging on a hook on the wall nearest the stairs. Barok had new locks installed on each cell door, along with the new keys. The PC's will easily be able to tell this. None of the cells are inhabited.\n\tA search of the cells reveals nothing of value, except some straw for sleeping and crumbs of old rotting food. Old blood stains and other darker stains will be found as well.\n\tThe well is functioning fine and draws good drinking water. It will take one round to lower bucket and three rounds to raise the bucket without spillage.\n\n7-PARAPET ROOF : You are at the summit of the tower. Parapet protected, this is an archers dream. An old broken and rotting trebuchet lies in ruins near the center. Rubble and wood lie everywhere. This vantage point can see for several hundred yards in every direction, giving a great view of the surrounding countryside.\n\tThis will be Lorren's place when the PC's first arrive. She will do her best to target spellcasters first. Spellcasters or others not protected well enough, better find good concealment and cover fast! Lorren will ONLY join a melee as a last resort and if it looks inevitable that they will lose, she will surrunder after trying to escape.\n\tThe parapet has an opening at each cardinal point along with four other openings in middle of each cardinal point; total of 8 openings - N, S, E, W, NE, SE, SW, NW\n\tNothing of value will be found on the roof.\n\n8-SECRET PORTAL : The ladder ends in an alcove which is adjacent to a curved passageway going to your left and right. The passageway itself is very rough, as if mined a long time ago. Each passage seems to lead into a bigger area. This area seems unused for a very long time. Dust has settled everywhere. The ceiling in the passageway is about twelve feet high.\n\tWhen a PC enters the circular room beyond, read the following : The passageway has come upon the rest of this circular room. A pillar of stone connects floor and ceiling towards the east side of the room. Four large wide steps of ornate marble rises to a platform about three feet off the ground. A majestic large diamond-shaped wooden frame rests upon the platform and rises almost to the ceiling, a height of eight feet total. What is strange is that no picture is within the frame.\n\tA Tiefling Tanarukk (Faerun pg.72) will be hiding in this room ready to surprise the PC's if he heard them coming down the ladder or entering the room. The Tiefling was teleported here through the portal recently and hasn't made for an escape. He has been waiting for the Portal to become active again. Roll a Listen check if PC's are being sneaky. Roll a Hide check for the Tanarukk if he hears the PC's.\n\tThis room has an ancient portal created by an evil wizard long before Captain Granjis took command of the Fort. The portal was malfunctioning at the time, and atleast a dozen Ta'narri found their way into this room. They found their way to the surface and began to kill anything that moved, leaving only a few survivors. Captain Granjis was killed during this attack. The Ta'narri then returned home to tell of their great deed and to bring more into this plane. Unfortunately, their luck ran out, for when they returned, the portal was dead and non-functioning. Those in the area never knew how close death was...The portal does function for very short periods (usually no more than a minute), but then becomes inert again for a year or more.\n\tYou can use this portal as an adventure hook in your campaign. If the PC's can find a magical token to activate the portal or a spell they might be able to go through it. Maybe it takes the PC's to another plane, filled with evil outsiders. Maybe it takes them across the Realms to a distant city. Or into the depths of a buried catacomb or dungeon fraught with death and riches. Read about Portals in the Realms in the FORGOTTEN REALMS CAMPAIGN BOOK pg. 59.\n\tA search of the Tiefling reveals 176gp over stuffed into a large belt pouch & a potion of Clauraudience/Clairvoyance. This is treasure the Tiefling found on some material plane travellers, before he was transported through the portal.\n\n-Tanarukk Tiefling : CR 2; Size Medium; HD 5d8; hp 35; Init +1 (dex); Spd 20ft.; AC 15 (+1 dex, +4 natural); Attacks Battleaxe +8 melee, or bite +7 melee; Damage Battleaxe 1d8+3, or bite 1d6+3; SQ Fire resistance 15, control flame, SR 14; SV Fort +4, Ref +5, Will +3; AL Chaotic Evil; Str 15, Dex 12, Con 11, Int 11, Wis 8, Cha 6\n\nSkills and Feats : Hide +9, Intimidate +6, Listen +9, Search +8, Spot +9; Alertness, Weapon Focus (battleaxe)\n\n\n\n\t\t\tCHAPTER III\n\n\t\tINTERCEPTING BAROK\n\tBarok and his men left 36 hours ago! The PC's will have to march double-time to catch up! It takes about 7 1/4 days to reach Baldurs Gate on horseback. \t\n\tNOTE***Use the forced march rules in the PHB.pg143 to see if the PC's can : \n\t\n\tA-Intercept Barok and his men before he gets to Baldurs Gate. The PC's might be heavily overmatched in a battle without             \t    Trellicks men to help.\n\tB-Getting to the ambush site on time to help Trellick Amaze beat Barok and his men.\n\tC-Failing to intercept Barok and failing to help stop ambush. Trellick WILL lose final battle without PC's help.\n\n\tDistance from Granjis Fort to Baldurs Gate is approximately 232miles.\n\n\tMore than likely, the PC's horses (if any) will be forced marched to death, unless they use healing spells or herbs to keep the horses alive. Subdual damage from forced marching is really due to fatigue of the body and mind. You may rightfully rule that healing CANT be used to heal this kind of damage. This will put the PC's on foot and at a slower pace. Don't stop the PC's from catching Barok and his men on the road before they get to the climatic ambush against Trellick and Coster Y. Kudos to the PC's for succeeding at a very hard task. Fighting \n\n\tRandom Encounters :\n\nDay 1 : No encounters\n\nDay 2 : An encounter with three (3) bugbears. The bugbears have been banished from their tribe and are now looking for a new location to start their own clan. This attack will come at nighttime, with the bugbears attracted to the PC's by their talking and laughter and the sight of fire. Even while force marching, the PC's will need to stop and rest. If not, then the bugbears will attack openly.\n\n-Bugbears (3) : CR 2; Size Medium; HD 3d8+3; hp 25,21,18; Init +1 (dex); Spd 30ft.; AC 17 (+1 dex, +3 natural, +2 leather, +1 small shield); Attacks Morningstar +4 melee, or javelin +3 ranged; Damage Morningstar 1d8+2, or javelin 1d6+2; SQ Darkvision 60ft.; SV Fort +2, Ref +4, Will +1; AL Chaotic Evil; Str 15, Dex 12, Con 13, Int 10, Wis 10, Cha 9\n\nSkills and Feats : Alertness\n\n\nDay 3-7 : No encounters (except possibly running into Barok and passing merchants/travellers). Day 5 precipation : Heavy rainstorm starting at 7am, which then turns into a light rainstorm at 1pm, lasting another 13 hours. \n\n\n\t\tROADSIDE INTERCEPT\n\tIf the PC's are able to catch Barok's men before they get to Baldurs Gate, run combat normally using the following guidelines. The PC's will be up against twelve (12) of Barok's bandits, along with Derrton, Roop (if alive), Brollun (if alive), and ofcourse Barok. \n\tBarok won't get heavily involved in the combat, preferring to stay to the outskirts and use a ranged weapon as much as possible. He didn't expect this at all, but still has very little respect for the resourcefulness and skills of the PC's.\n\n\tUpon catching Barok's men, the PC's might see they're overmatched and might just follow at a safe distance, thus guaranting themselves being ontime to help Trellick win this battle. This would be the smartest move to make.\n\n\t\tHELPING TRELLICK\n\tIf the PC's are able to get to the ambush location (a vacated warehouse on the outskirts of Baldurs Gate near the east gates-refer to map), whether by tailing Barok and his men or by barely making it ontime, they will be able to help Trellick win the battle and maybe even warn him before the attack, time permitting.\n\tRun combat normally, but this time Barok will be more involved in the melee aspect of the combat. Barok will now have a strong disliking for the PC's, and may forego attacking Trellick and his men, for an unlucky PC.\n\tIf the battle starts going badly for Barok, he will attempt to flee by whatever means possible.\n\n\t\tFALLING SHORT\n\tIf the PC's can't make it to help Trellick and fail to intercept Barok on the road, then Trellick, Prestice, and his few bodyguards will be killed. The PC's will have failed in the overall adventure goal. :(\n\tThey might arrive just minutes late, and come across what remains of Barok's group. A fight is still very possible. Barok and his bandits will only stay for about 10 minutes after the fight ends.\n\n-Bandits (6), male human Ftr1: CR 1; Size M; HD 1d10+1; hp 11; Init +0 ; Spd 30 ft.; AC 16 (+4 chainshirt, +2 large steel shield); Attack +3 melee (+1 masterwork longsword), or +0 ranged; SV Fort +5, Ref +0, Will -3; AL NE; Str 14, Dex 10, Con 13, Int 12, Wis 5, Cha 6.\n\nLanguages Spoken: Aquan, Common.\n\nSkills and feats: Bluff +0, Diplomacy +0, Hide +0, Jump +2, Listen -3, Move silently +0, Pick pocket +0, Spot -3, Wilderness lore -1; Great fortitude, Quick draw, Weapon focus (longsword).\n\nPossessions: Chainshirt, large steel shield, masterwork longsword, punching dagger, 3d10+5gp, 1d100+25sp\n\n-Bandits (3), male human Ftr1: CR 1; Size M; HD 1d10+1; hp 11; Init +0 ; Spd 30 ft.; AC 16 (+4 chainshirt, +2 large steel shield); Attack +1 melee (+1 weapon focus longsword), or +2 ranged (+1 masterwork arrows); SV Fort +5, Ref +0, Will -3; AL NE; Str 10, Dex 13, Con 13, Int 12, Wis 5, Cha 6.\n\nLanguages Spoken: Aquan, Common.\n\nSkills and feats: Bluff +0, Diplomacy +0, Hide +0, Jump +2, Listen -3, Move silently +0, Pick pocket +0, Spot -3, Wilderness lore -1; Great fortitude, Quick draw, Weapon focus (longbow).\n\nPossessions: Chainshirt, large steel shield (if in melee), longbow, 20 masterwork arrows, 20 arrows, longsword, dagger, 3d10+5gp, 1d100+30sp\n\n\n-Bandits (3), male human Rgr1 : CR 1; Size M; HD 1d10-1; hp 9; Init +3 (+3 Dex); Spd 30 ft.; AC 13 (+3 Dex); Attack +3 melee, or +4 ranged, Two-weapon -1 (Scimitar)/-2 (shortsword); SV Fort +1, Ref +3, Will +1; AL LE; Str 14, Dex 17, Con 9, Int 9, Wis 12, Cha 12.\n\nLanguages Spoken: Common.\n\nSkills and feats: Animal empathy +5, Hide +3, Intuit direction +5, Knowledge (nature) +1, Listen +1, Move silently +3, Search +3, Spot +1, Use rope +5; Point blank shot, [Track], Weapon focus (scimitar).\n\nPossessions: Chainshirt, scimitar, shortsword, longbow, 25 arrows, 3d10+7gp, 1d100+22sp\n\n\n\n\t\t\tENDING THE ADVENTURE\n\n\t\tSUCCESS\n\tThe PC's should be quite pleased with themselves, having come a long way through many miles and several cities. Trellick will be very pleased with the PC's and they will gain a lifelong ally. The PC's original employer, Abyl Berrico, will also be pleased with the PC's and upon their return to Waterdeep, will have a meeting with them detailing that their debt owed (to Rogues Guild in Waterdeep) is now paid in full. Abyl is yet another good ally to have.\n\tTrellick will invite the PC's to his mansion and will introduce the PC's to his wife and one of his sons, named Ryssa and Bruno. A large gourmet dinner will be served to the PC's, then Trellick will call the PC's into his office. Bruno will be present.\n\tTrellick's home office is a lush quarters. An ornate desk and several large leather bound chairs dominate this room. Shelves line all the walls. A peachy smell comes from some burning incense. Trellick and his second son, Bruno, are present. Trellick says \"You all have been through so much and to think, it's all been to help me! You have done so well and I am forever indebted to you. If you ever need a favor from me, just give me the when and where. I'm going to compensate you for all your hard work. I think you will be pleased.\". Trellick calls out his butler's name,Brinton, and shortly after, a door opens and you see an older human male with graying balding hair pushing a cart into the room. Your eyes are immediately attracted to the two large metal armors atop the cart. A small bag is also on the top shelf. On the shelf below, you see a large ornate composite bow and a sheated sword. Trellick says \"This is from my own personal treasury.\".\n\n\tGems in small bag : Carnelian (red chalcedony) 38gp, Holly blue agate (has violet tinges) 7gp, and a Skydrop 83gp\n\tRing in small bag : Large gold ring, curlicue motif, with a claw holding a large round alexandrite gem (1,115.3 gp-A ring that has been in the Amaze family for 30+years passed to Trellick from his Aunt)\n\tBreastplate armor is on the top shelf\n\tFull plate armor is on the top shelf\n\tLarge masterwork Fullblade (Sword&Fist)\n\tLarge mighty composite longbow (+1 Str bonus)\n\n\tAfter the PC's examine each item, Trellick explains about the ring being a family heirloom, and that he wants the PC's to keep it as a trophy.\n\n\t\"Please keep the ring as a reminder of my thanks to all of you in saving the Amaze family from disaster. I am going to be heading south to Athkatla in Amn on business, and will be leaving Bruno here to handle the family business in Baldurs Gate. Bruno will see to it that you get any help you need in my absence.\". Bruno says \"Absolutely! You guys are what the Realms needs more of. Anything you need, just give me a holler. My father here has left me in full control. He just hopes there is a business left when he returns. Eh father!?\". Bruno laughs. Trellick laughs as well.\n\n\tIf Barok escaped the final battle and lives, read the following : \"Don't worry about Barok. Between that last battle and your exploits agaisnt him elsewhere, the man surely must be broken. His ambition will bring him back someday, I'm sure. But for now, rest easy, knowing we have won.\" Trellick smiles.\n\n\n\t\tFAILURE\n\tThe PC's fail the adventure main goal if Trellick dies during the ambush OR any time during the adventure. The PC's could also likely be killed during the final battle. If they are losing and try to escape, Barok's men will not follow, but will also make sure the PC's do leave the vicinity.\n\tThis could lead to more adventures against Barok. The Amaze family will be saddened by the loss of their Patriach. Trellick's youngest son, Bruno, is just about ready to take over the family business. Will he be subjected to extortion & assassination attempts by Barok once he finds out? Bruno Amaze might hire the PC's to hunt down and kill Barok Trizzle and his men responsible for the murder of his father.\n\tTrellick's home office is a lush quarters. An ornate desk and several large leather bound chairs dominate this room. Shelves line all the walls. A pine tree smell comes from some burning incense. Bruno speaks after several silent moments. The despair in his voice is quite evident. \"This is madness. All for one mans insane ambitions!? You did the best you could given the circumstances. My family and I applaud you for your efforts. Barok could very well come after me. I will not be able to rest until my father is avenged.\".  Bruno calls out his butler's name,Brinton, and shortly after, a door opens and you see an older human male with graying balding hair pushing a cart into the room. Your eyes are immediately attracted to the large metal armor atop the cart. A small bag is also on the top shelf. On the shelf below, you see a large ornate composite bow and a sheated sword. Bruno says \"This is from my fathers own personal treasury. He would have wanted you to have this.\".\n\n\tGems in small bag : Carnelian (red chalcedony) 38gp, Holly blue agate (has violet tinges) 7gp, and a Skydrop 83gp\n\tRing in small bag : Large silver & gold ring in the shape of a snake. The eyes each hold two small rubies. (700gp - A specially crafted item created and worn by Trellick Amaze)\n\tBreastplate armor is on the top shelf\n\tLarge masterwork Fullblade (Sword&Fist)\n\tLarge mighty composite longbow (+1 Str bonus)\n\n\tAllow the PC's to examine their compensation.\n\n\t\"Please keep the ring as a reminder of my thanks to all of you in your help for the Amaze family. You all are invited to my fathers funeral in two days time. Maybe we can all keep in touch somehow? I might be calling on you again real soon, so don't go too far now, ya hear? Don't worry about me. I'll manage. We all will manage.\".\n\n\n\t\tREWARDS\n\tThere is several ways you can hand out experience points as per the DMG. In my campaign, I give out experience based on story awards. They are awarded experience on the spot, for each section of the adventure they complete.\n\tYou can add up each encounter in this adventure and give out experience points that way if you like. If not, use the following table :\n\n\t400 each - For reaching Baldurs Gate\n\t400 each - For saving Trellick Amaze from poisoned food\n\t***200 each - If Trellick Amaze eats the food but lives (100 if Trellick dies)\n\t400 each - For defeating bandits at Granjis Fort and getting the information necessary to find out about final assault against                  \t                Trellick Amaze.\n\t400 each - If Trellick Amaze lives in the final assault Vs. Barok & his bandits.\n\t***200 each - If Trellick Amaze dies in the final assault Vs. Barok & his bandits (none if PC's didn't make it the final \t                      assault)\n\t+100 each - If Trellick Amaze was made aware of the ambush before it happened\n\n\tThis table does NOT include any role playing or session awards you might hand out, nor does it include any bonuses for smart play, creativity, and good ideas. If they deserve an award, give it to them ON THE SPOT or at the beginning of the next session!\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\tCAST OF MAJOR NPC's\n\t\n\tNOTE***The following NPC's are in alphabetical order.

Evil.\n\nA Dungeons and or Dragons adventure for a party of 1st - 3rd  level. \n\nBy Weston Prestage.  \n\n Agentfestaskull@hotmail.com\n\nI made this adventure when I was 14 and I have converted it to\n\n3.5 and the Pathfinder System, yet preserving it with the zaniness\n\nof the ideas I had back then, in addition I have expanded it and\n\nadded lots of cool things from various sources...\n\nIt was created in the twisted yet simplistic style of the mind of a\n\n14 year old Dungeon Master who ran a group of four players in a\n\nsmall town in rural Whitianga New Zealand in the year 1991, but it\n\nhas been edited for comprehensibility.\n\nImportant Note: \n\nIn reading this Adventure, be very certain you don’t go past a\n\nword you don’t fully understand. \n\n“The only reason a person gives up a study or becomes confused or\n\nunable to learn is because he or she has gone past a word that was\n\nnot understood.”- Basic study manual. LRH.\n\nThe confusion or inability to grasp or learn comes AFTER a word\n\nthat the person did not have defined and understood.\n\nA good resource for definitions is www.dictionary.com \n\n\n\nI would Love to hear from you on how my adventure played out.\n\nAny questions / comments can be directed to me- Weston Latimer\n\nPrestage   at   agentfestaskull@hotmail.com \n\n......................\n\nShadowdale...\n\nA group of powerful adventurers have found the hideout of an evil\n\nmage, long thought to be dead, slain four years ago in Myth\n\nDrannor. His allies and henchmen seem to be of the lesser type, so\n\na notice has gone up on the town noticeboard, giving the lairs\n\nlocation.\n\nThus, any would be adventurers could go and interfere with his\n\nevil plans by invading his evil den.\n\nAnyone who applies to the local temple of Tymora is given a map\n\nand any extra basic gear they may want, one potion of healing each\n\nand free healing if they get back to the temple alive.\n\nThe lair is about eight hours walk away through the forest to the\n\nnorth and the party is given a good map to it. \n\nEncounters on the way are up to DM.\n\n..........................................\n\n\n\n\n\n1.  THE LAIR.\n\nAfter a time the party comes to the entrance of the base....\n\nSmoke can be detected as the party approach- This smoke comes\n\nfrom impossible to find hidden chimneys designed to diffuse the\n\nsmoke and prevent the chimneys discovery.\n\nThe wooden hatch that conceals the ladder into the lair is hidden\n\nat the base of a 20 ft high boulder that sits in the forest.\n\nOn a Notice check DC 18 a character may see four goblins hiding\n\nin the trees. They have crude light crossbows, and will fire on the\n\nparty hoping to entice them to run at them.\n\nOn a Notice check DC 25 a goblin, hiding and holding a rope will be\n\nrevealed. If he is not seen he will pull this rope tight and it will\n\nspring up to neck level hopefully snagging and brutalizing running\n\nparty members.\n\n \n\nTrap: Rope springing out at neck level.\n\nReflex save DC 15 to duck in time .\n\nIf this is failed the player takes 1-3 subdual damage is stunned for a\n\nround and is knocked prone.\n\nSearch: DC 15 to see the leaf and dirt covered rope.\n\nDisable: Just don’t run into it - or mince the goblin hiding behind the\n\ntree holding the rope.\n\nThe 5 goblins are minions of Abrax and have 14 crude goblin silver\n\nbetween them. \n\n\n\n2.  THE WOODEN HATCH.\n\nA five foot round wooden disk covers a four foot round hole that\n\ndrops down into the ground. A strong rope ladder is fastened to the\n\nwall and leads down into smoky darkness.\n\nAs soon as the hatch is lifted a mass of smoke billows out and once\n\nfinally cleared light smoke continues to come from the hole. High\n\npitched screaming can be heard from below.\n\nNOTE : The tunnels are at best 6 foot high and five foot wide. They\n\nhave been carved out of the earth and rock by goblins and orcs. Doors\n\nare crude and made of wood from the forest above.\n\n3. FIRST HALL.\n\nAt the base of the ladder lies the body of a butchered goblin ( Killed\n\nby the out of control children. \n\nThe smoke comes from the east and yelling and screaming goblins and\n\nbarking can be heard from this direction. \n\nSuddenly out of the smoke comes a crowd of goblin children pushing a\n\nwheeled torture rack on which a goblin child wails torturously. The\n\ngoblin children are unsupervised and have gone mad with freedom\n\ninduced power. Two wolf pups leap and bark about them.\n\nWhen they see the party the scream and rush, swarming and biting and\n\nstabbing with small knives and sharpened sticks.\n\nThere are 20 of the children and 2 pups.\n\nTreat the children as 1/3 strength goblins and the pups as 1/3\n\nstrength wolves. \n\nOf course once the battle turns against them they will flee, but while\n\nthey are in a mob they gain the benefit of the swarmfighting feat.\n\n\n\n   Swarmfighting Feat. This allows up to four of them to occupy a single\n\n5' square and gain a + 1 bonus on the attack roll for each additional\n\nally beyond the first attacking the target but only if the target is\n\nmedium or larger.  \n\n 4. TORTURE CRATES.\n\nThis room contains crates of torture devices in packed and unpacked\n\nstates. The goblin children have managed to assemble a kit set rack and\n\nthere is half of a kit set Iron Maiden assembled.\n\nThe room is very smoky, obscuring a trap above the door.  \n\nTrap: Broadsword balancing over door\n\nReflex save DC 12 to dive back from it  in time .\n\nIf this is failed the falling sword gets at attack at +3 and does 1-6 dam.\n\nSearch: Notice DC 12 to see the leaf and dirt covered rope.\n\nDisable: Just take it down off the door.\n\n5. BONFIRE ROOM.\n\nThis room has a bonfire going in it ! Most of the smoke escapes through\n\na hole in the ceiling, which then drifts out through cracks in the earth up\n\ninto the forest.  Vision is reduced to 10 feet and those in the room must\n\nhold their breaths or suffer from heavy smoke ( DMG ).\n\nRocks occasionally pop and hot fragments shoot out of the fire.\n\nPCs in the room must make a reflex save DC 10 every 1d6 rounds or be\n\nhit by a hot fragment for one damage. Characters in med or heavy\n\narmor are immune to this effect.\n\n6. PRISON.\n\nThe door to this tunnel is slightly sturdier than the others and is locked\n\nwith a crude lock.\n\n\n\nThe tunnel leads to a roundish room with five 15 ft deep pits in the\n\nfloor.\n\nPit 1. Within this pit is a carrion Crawler which functions as a refuse\n\neater.\n\nPit 2. Lying in a ball on the floor of this pit is a wounded, dying and\n\nstarving bugbear with 3 HP.\n\nPit 3. Standing in this pit is a stronger bugbear with 12 HP.\n\nPit 4. This pit contains a dead goblin.\n\nPit 5. In this pit is a captured Elf ( Elf War 1 ) standing Knee deep in\n\napples. His name is Radia.\n\n7.  ROOM OF THE DEAD.\n\nThis Iron bound door to this room is barred from the inside. Goblin\n\nrunes on the door say “DEAD SCARY THINGS ABRAXS STUFF” \n\nWithin the room are:\n\n15 Skeleton Rats. ( 1 hp + 0 BaB 1 damage on hit AC 16 ).\n\n10 Goblin Skeletons. \n\nDirt and wood steps lead up to a secret exit in the form of an earth\n\ncovered trapdoor in the ceiling.\n\nLying on the ground is a halflings skeleton with a small amount of dried\n\nflesh still attached, his cloak and clothes are torn to shreds and it looks\n\nlike he went down fighting. \n\nLaying about is his stuff:   A short sword, a silk rope and grapnel, a 6ft\n\npole, a decayed and moldy backpack full of rotten food, two halfling\n\nmade alchemist fires, a milky blue potion ( Levitation ). \n\nHis rotted pouch contains 32 Tricrowns ( PP ) and a blue quartz (18gp).\n\n8. RATTUS RATTUS \n\n\n\nSix smoked giant rats hang from the ceiling here and when the players\n\nreach this area two goblins will be in the area  patrolling the area from\n\nthe north. They are armed with short bows and short swords. \n\nAny player stating that they are listening can hear the sounds of goblin\n\nlaughter and merriment coming from 9. \n\n9. GOBLIN PIERCER GAMBLE.\n\nThe cave like ceiling of this room is home to eight 1HD piercers ( see\n\nMONSTERS section ). \n\nA crowd of 14 goblins are hanging just outside the room and are betting\n\non the chances of a sole goblin who is running back and forth across the\n\nroom. If the party is not already mincing the goblins and they are seen,\n\nthe lead goblin will call out to them in common: “ You must be Abraxs’\n\nfriends, do you want to bet with us ?” .\n\nThe goblins have a total of 125 cp, 32 sp and 15 gp. \n\nA pierced goblin corpse lies on the other side of the room. He has a\n\nMasterwork halfling made short sword with the name “ Dunbras”\n\ncarved on it as well as 3 gp and 8 sp of Hillsfar mint.  \n\nIf a battle ensues the goblins will run into the piercer room and try to\n\nentice the piercers to drop on the party.\n\n10. RATS VRS WEASELS PARTY.\n\nThe door to this room is barred. Within a crowd of Six drunk goblins\n\nare watching a fight between four giant rats and a pack of 12 weasels.\n\nThey are cheering and hollering from atop a rickety wooden bridge that\n\nspans the room. A ramp leads up to one side of the bridge and the\n\nbridge leads out through a tunnel six feet up the wall on the other side.\n\n\n\nIf the door is opened the rats and weasels will attempt to escape. They\n\nwill not fight unless cornered. The goblins will then rain down abuse,\n\nurine and the empty barrel. The goblins will not come down from their\n\nbridge and will fight to the drunken screaming death. \n\nOne gutted rat lies on the floor of the room.\n\n11. BUNZWIKS ROOM.\n\nBoth of the doors leading to Bunzwiks room are barred. If he hears\n\nbreaking noises or if anyone knocks on his door he will demand to know\n\nwho is there, while he hastily dons his armor and loads his X bow.\n\nHe rents this room off Abrax for Five gold a week and occasionally\n\ndoes small human mercenary type missions for him. He is not\n\nnecessarily hostile. \n\nSee NPCs for his stats. \n\nHis room reeks and contains a bed and a table covered in food scraps\n\nand a set of copper cups, pots and pans.\n\nA locked and trapped steel strongbox rests in one corner. \n\nA ladder leads up to a concealed trapdoor that leads out.\n\nTrap: Steel spike shooting randomly from chest.\n\nReflex save DC 14 to dive back from it  in time .\n\nIf this is failed the spike strikes at +10 and hits for 1-4 damage.\n\nSearch: DC 20 to see the mechanism. \n\nDisable: DC 22.\n\nIt contains two sets of reeking fighter clothes, a torn pair of boots, \n\n116 gp ( Sembian florins ) 250 gp ( Hillsfar Shills ) 2 pp ( Cormyrian\n\nTricrowns ), 2 Waterdeep Toals ( worth 2 gp in Waterdeep ),  Six\n\n\n\nblue/green chysodonals ( 25 gp each ), One pale yellow Witherlite ( 70\n\ngp ).\n\n12. GOBLIN GRAVE ROOM.\n\nEight stones mark the goblin graves in this dirt floored room.\n\nA large stone marks the grave of an old evil goblin leader. \n\nFour giant rats are digging at the grave by the large headstone...\n\nAnd if left they will dig up a the old goblin leader !\n\nHe is a Coffer Corpse now ! See MONSTERS.\n\nBuried with him is a rotted wooden shield and a rusty battleaxe.  He\n\nwears a copper ring set with a 450gp topaz.\n\n13. WATERFALL POOL ROOM.\n\nThis large cave is filled with a massive pool. A 15 ft high waterfall feeds\n\nthe pool and a tunnel carries water out to the north. The north river\n\ngoes on for 2000 yards before reaching the surface.\n\nThe pool is only about three feet deep and the walls of the cave are\n\nhanging with an immense amount of lichen. \n\n12 Rothe graze about the edges of the room. \n\nRothe resemble musk oxen, with long shaggy coats of thick black/brown\n\nhair. They stand 4 feet high and are good swimmers. Twice a day they\n\ncan cast Dancing Lights to communicate to other members of the herd.\n\nThey are immune to any ill effects of mold and fungus. \n\nThey are pretty unintelligent animals and would react as such is the\n\nparty decide to harass them.\n\nThey are calmly eating the lichen.\n\n\n\nNear the entrance tunnel lies a Lichensack. This is an unintelligent\n\nVermin shapechanger that can change from a large patch of lichen into\n\nan average sized sack of heavy brown cloth for up to an hour at a time.\n\nIt uses this ability to protect it from lichen eating predators. It is\n\ncurrently in sack form.\n\nSitting on the large rock and possibly alerted to the partys presence is\n\na young boy. This is Abraxs son- Jolly Jim. Jim is not jolly at the\n\ninterruption of his game of “Throwing rocks at the Rothe” and he will\n\ncast a spell at the party and then flee to tell his dad on them. The\n\ngravel strewn tunnel to the SW leads to the RICKETY STAIRS # 1 of\n\nLevel 2.\n\nSee NPCS for Stats.  \n\nIn the pool lurks a giant Moray Eel ( see MONSTERS ). It will only\n\nattack creatures entering the water, it is the reason there are so many\n\nRothe in the room... They swam in from the waterfall area and are too\n\nscared to swim out.\n\n14. GOBLIN ROOMS.\n\nThese rooms are filled with stinking rotted food and meats, goblin\n\nweapons lie about the place. A disease has run through the warrens,\n\nwhich is why there are only three very sick goblins in here. One in each\n\nroom. The rooms are filled with trash and a goblin lies on a pile of trash\n\nin each room.\n\nTwo of them are defenseless but one has a loaded Light X bow. \n\nBuried in the corner of the far room ( Search DC 23 ) is a sack of 83\n\nsp and 152 gp. \n\n\n\nSecretly make a save for each player spending more than 2 minutes in\n\nthis area, or once for each infected item touched. A failure results in \n\n\n\nFester Fever. \n\nNew Disease - Fester Fever.\n\nFester Fever results in weakness and apathy while orange lumps spread\n\nabout the body.\n\nInfection - Touch or inhaled.  DC 10   Incubation 1-20 days \n\nDamage Str 1d3 Chr 1d3. The Charisma Drain is permanent. \n\nLEVEL 2.\n\nThe tunnels are between 7 and 8  feet high here, or they are widened\n\nnatural caves. They have been carved out of the earth and rock by\n\norcs, and ogres. Doors are thick and made of wood from the forest\n\nabove.\n\n1.   RICKETY STAIRS.\n\nRickety stairs made of old wooden boards lead from level 1 to level 2\n\nhere. They creak and twist alarmingly as they are traveled, requiring a\n\nDC 12 Acrobatics check to negotiate safely. The DC is increased by 1\n\nfor every lb over 200 that they player weighs ( including gear). Failure\n\nmeans the player crashes through the stairs and falls 40 ft. to the\n\nbottom. A nice DM may allow a check to grab on. \n\n2.  BOTTLE ROOM.\n\nThis dusty floored room is empty but for a corked smoky green glass\n\nbottle lying on the floor. It is filled with a very high quality wine.\n\nLurking and living in the wine in a tiny Throat Leech !\n\nA Throat Leech is an aquatic parasite that, when drunk by an\n\nunsuspecting adventurer, attaches itself to the back of the throat and\n\n\n\nswells with blood until it chokes the victim to death. The drinker will\n\nbegin to suffocate and will die unless some ingenious way of removing\n\nthe leech is devised. A good idea, some tools and a Heal check DC 16\n\nshould do it .\n\n3. ORC ROOM.\n\nThe door to this room is barred- the pass knock is a hard knock with\n\nboth hands but unless the party have got this from a monster on level 1\n\nthere is no way they will know this.\n\nThis room contains some bracken matts and hides as well as a table and\n\nbroken up furniture. A small bit of deer meat hangs from the ceiling\n\nand there are two sputtering torches on the walls.\n\nFive orcs are in this room in the process of painting more orcan graffiti\n\non the walls. These orcs are from the tribe of the Severed Bloody\n\nHead.\n\nIf they party has to break in they will be met by thrown spears, of\n\nwhich the orcs have 3 each.\n\nThe orcs are wearing human made studded leather and small shields.\n\nBetween them they have 42 Cormyrian Blue eyes ( Electrum pieces\n\nworth 5 silver each)  . The leader has a pair of Black Panther skin boots\n\nworth about 200 gp and a Black Onyx worth 380 gp.\n\nOn the wall is a large crude painting of a giant one eyed orc.\n\n4.  CRAZY ROPE TRAP.\n\nKnotted ropes hang here leading up to a tiny room which opens out\n\nthrough a camouflaged trap door to the surface. Four of the three\n\nropes have large stones attached to them and one is tied securely to a\n\n\n\nsturdy log, that lies across the hole in the floor of the tiny room. The\n\nropes are of various lengths, the longest one is the tied one. \n\nIf one of the rock ropes is pulled the rock will drop, falling down into\n\nthe face of the puller. A Reflex save DC 10 avoids 2d6 face whacking\n\ndamage.\n\n5. UNDERSTAIR OGRE.\n\nThese wooden stairs are sturdy but they are guarded by on Ogre !\n\nHe is well chained to a metal post but will throw rocks from his pile at\n\nthe party as they come down the 60 ft. of stairs.\n\nHe has a club and some meat and bones but no treasure. Stinking deer\n\nskins form a crude bed for him.\n\n6. THE DRAGONS.\n\nThis area has been hewn out of the dark earth and looks like a new\n\nconstruction. There is a mildewy smell as the party traverse the moldy\n\nwalkway that slopes down into this series of cavernous rooms.\n\nLurking about here invisibly is a Pseudo Dragon ( Details of this creature\n\nare listed in the Dragonomnicon ) but I have given some details in the\n\nMonsters Section of the Module.\n\nThe kindest looking PC will be contacted telepathically by the female\n\nPseudodragon - Who’s name is Spindle.\n\nThe PC will be begged to rid her of her old mate. She tells a blubbering\n\ntale of woe detailing the mates decent into madness, the eating of their\n\nchildren and the stealing of her treasure. She has been bitten and\n\n\n\nbeaten as well. She Begs the PC to help her, and will offer to lead them\n\nto his cave and reward them with his treasure.\n\nThe Moldy walkway leads into a muddy excavated cavern. To the\n\nnortheast is a small room containing a well made Well that drops down\n\ninto a pool of cool clean water.\n\n7.  Here it looks like the tunneling finished, but a two foot wide hole has\n\nbeen dug through into a large natural hollow beyond. \n\nWhen the orcs were digging this area out they were scared off by the\n\nDragons. Soon after they were scared off, part of the ceiling of area 9\n\ncollapsed, dampening their enthusiasm for more digging.\n\nA hideous rotting stench wafts from the two foot wide hole through the\n\ndirt that leads to the cavern beyond.\n\n8. THE ROOT FILLED HOLLOW. \n\nThis bowl shaped room arches 30 feet high and is adorned with long\n\nroots on the far wall. The roots come from a huge tree in the forest\n\nabove. 18 giant rat and two goblin corpses are scattered about the area\n\ndecaying, stinkily. \n\nHigh in the roots lurks a Yellow musk creeper, which infests the tree\n\nabove and below ground. There are three yellow musk goblins and one\n\nyellow musk Orc, concealed in the roots above ( see FF).  \n\n Vaarg the Pseudodragon has hidden his treasure up there in the roots...\n\nHe Hides invisibly behind some rocks and waits and watches, very\n\nawake.  \n\n\n\nThere is a tiny tunnel that leads up and out through the trunk of the\n\ntree, allowing the Dragons to travel to the surface.\n\nVaargs and Spindles treasure is secured in an oak barrel: \n\nA barrel [oak, 2 gp] contains a walking cane of fine wood, with a handle\n\nin the form of a horse [2 gp], an elegant umbrella made of orange silk\n\n[5gp] and a fine masterwork steel short sword in a black leather sheath\n\nembellished with white-painted dragons [65 gp]. The sword hilt is a riot\n\nof color, with seven gems in as many shades [malachite, lapis\n\nlazuli, carnelian, moonstone, citrine, tigereye and obsidian; short sword\n\n225 gp]. Plain linen [1 yard, 4 gp] is wrapped around a hand-high crystal\n\nvase, which is delicately beautiful [148 gp]. A large leather-bound book\n\nis wedged beside it. The book is a work of art with fine leather covers\n\nhighlighted in gold leaf, but it has been heavily used. It is a classic work\n\non the physics of magic [1000 gp]. A large silver bowl with decorative\n\ndesigns cut out along the rim [46 gp] holds a pile of two-tined silver\n\nforks [18; 5 gp each], a pair of fine, white calfskin gloves for small\n\nhands [5 gp], and a small stuffed toy dog—very worn—with jeweled\n\neyes and a gem on its collar [obsidian eyes, red-brown garnet on the\n\ncollar; stuffed dog, 120 gp]. You have to tug to get the bowl and book\n\nout, but under them you find a soft pouch [5 sp] containing a butterfly,\n\ncut of green quartz [40 gp]; a silver and gold holy symbol [to a god who\n\nprotects travelers; 50 gp]; an onyx medallion [142 gp] and coins [23 gp,\n\n57 sp, 122 cp].\n\n............................\n\nOnce Vaarg is dead Spindle may ask to accompany the party depending\n\non how they have conducted themselves. She cannot stand arguing or\n\nyelling. Once sure of a good friendship she will give them a tigers eye\n\ninset electrum ring of Nightvision. This ring only works above ground at\n\nnight but bestows full darkvision up to the characters range of sight.\n\n\n\n9. COLLAPSED TEMPLE ROOM.\n\nTwelve giant rats chew on the bodies in this room. Six of them will flee\n\nfrom the party into the burrows the honeycomb this place.\n\nA Huge stone head of a heavily scarred Orc, lies on top of a decaying\n\norc body. Seven other decayed bodies lie about the room, each pinned\n\nunder rubble. It is obvious that the Orcs were trying to carve out a\n\ntemple of sorts here before a cave in occurred. The Orcs have no\n\npossessions other than some mining equipment, trapped under the rocks\n\nwith them. One orc has a pouch that holds an robins egg sized black\n\npearl, that was going to used as an eye ( 300gp ) . The pouch also\n\ncontains the smashed remains of the other pearl that was going to be\n\nthe other eye.\n\n10. STAGNANT POND.\n\nThis are opens up into a wide cavern, filled with a muck and rubble\n\nchocked, stagnant, spring fed pond. It is spanned by a rickety bridge.\n\nWhile rickety the bridge is safe and can support 500lbs at a time. \n\nThe pond is 12 ft. deep at its deepest point. Floating in small patches\n\nabout the pond is 22 aromatic moss plants. They fill the area with the\n\nsmell of cinnamon. They could be gathered and sold for up to 8 gold\n\neach if kept alive.\n\nIf the party has light or is making noise, the Orcs will be alerted and\n\nwill plie out from their guard room, and shoot their short bows at the\n\nparty as they try to cross the bridge.  \n\nThe Six Orcs are armed with short swords and short bows. \n\nThey wear Studded Leather and have Medium shields.\n\n\n\n11. GUARD ROOM.\n\nThis is a small stinky guardroom. It is empty but for a crudely made\n\nthree tiered bunk, bedecked with reeking blankets and a door which\n\nleads to a room containing a long long ladder that leads up and out a\n\nsecret trapdoor to the forest above. \n\n12. TABLE ROOM. \n\nThis orc dining room is a total mess. The well used table is covered in\n\nstains and rotten food. The floor is a mess of smashed clay plates. Only\n\na few copper plates remain unbroken. \n\nPainted on the wall is the banner of the Orc Tribe of the Severed\n\nBloody Head.\n\nLying comatose under the table are two orcs in a state of severe\n\nintoxication. \n\n13. TRAINING AREA.\n\nThis is a large trashed training room. \n\nThere are a few piles of garbage, broken pots and a smashed bench in\n\nhere.\n\nThere is a small assortment of orc weapons here: 2 halberds, 1 short\n\nsword, a broken battle axe, and a shield with no straps.\n\nA small round wooden table has a parchment letter pinned to it with a\n\ndagger.\n\nThe letter reads :\n\nSLORF, \n\n\n\n             GATHER YOUR FELLOWS AND HEAD\n\nNORTH EAST ABOUT SIX MILES. IN THAT\n\nAREA YOU WILL SEEK OUT AND DESTROY A\n\nCLAN OF GNOMES TRYING TO SET UP A\n\nVILLAGE. BRING ME EVERYTHING YOU FIND!\n\nMY MAGIC WILL KNOW IF YOU DON’T AND IT\n\nWILL PUNISH YOU. DON’T EVEN THINK\n\nABOUT BRINGING ANY WOMEN DOWN\n\nHERE. I DIDDNT BRING YOU FROM YOUR\n\nTRIBE TO START A FAMILY. YOU WILL BE\n\nPAYED WHEN YOU GET BACK. DON’T\n\nCOMPLAIN TO ME ABOUT HAVING NO\n\nMONEY WHEN ALL YOUR MEN DID WITH IT\n\nWAS BUY GROG OFF BUNZWIK. \n\nIM ALSO MAD THAT YOU ORCILIZED YOUR\n\nLIVING AREA. IT’S A MESS ! CLEAN IT UP\n\nOR FEEL MY MAGIC WRATH !\n\nABRAX THE SCARILY EVIL.\n\nThe whole area shows signs of very recent departure and it is still warm\n\nwith the heat and stench of many orc bodies.\n\nThe Orcs left only 20 minutes after the partys arrival !\n\n14. BUNK ROOM. \n\n\n\n8 bunks lie around the walls of this dirty trashed room.\n\nJunk and bones lie ankle deep in some places.\n\n2 Orogs lurk in this room - See MONSTERS.\n\n These are a pair of especially gifted Orogs that have mastered two\n\nweapon fighting and chop down their enemies with a battle axe in each\n\nhand.\n\nOne of the Battle axes is a finely made magical one with a black wooden\n\nhandle and a flame style blade. It is + 1 . Don’t forget to factor that in.\n\nOne of the Orogs has a Torc made of copper and electrum worth 23gp.\n\nA long long ladder leads up to a secret trapdoor to the surface, which is\n\nan option if the battle turns against the Orogs.\n\nSIDE QUEST : THE HELP THE NOMES.\n\nThere is an option here for a side quest. \n\nThe party may want to help save the Nomes....\n\nThey could either try to track the orcs and fight them alone, or rush to\n\nhelp the Nomes. The orcs have gotten lost and will arrive at the gnome\n\nencampment four hours after the party.\n\nHere are some details that will make such a side quest possible.\n\nThe Gnome encampment :\n\nThis consists of a small group of 14 Gnome Frontiersmen. They are living\n\nin tents and they are just starting to dig their homes and terrafrom the\n\nland.  They will be initially wary of the party but will soon become\n\nfriendly. They will tell the party that orcs sacked and burned the area\n\n\n\nthe were in so they left to make a new home. The rest of the Gnome\n\nclan will be here in eight days. \n\nArmaments: The Gnomes have short bows and short swords, daggers\n\nand slings.\n\n8 Gnomes have studded leather and shields.\n\n5 Have chain mail and shields. \n\nTheir leader has a suit of Plate Mail and a Short Bow of Accuracy:+ 3 to\n\nhit, treats all ranges as short.\n\nThey also have some trained animals to help them.\n\n10 Badgers, 2 Giant Badgers and 3 Wolves.\n\nWhen warned about the attack the Gnomes set about digging foxholes\n\nand setting traps ! The party is allowed to assist in any way they seem\n\nbest.\n\nThe Orc Raiders : \n\nThere are 30 orcs in the raiding party. With out the help of the party,\n\nand even possible with the partys help, the Gnomes will be wiped out.\n\n10 of the Orcs are Pike men. \n\nThey have Studded leather, Huge shields and short swords.\n\nThey will come at the gnomes in a dangerous V formation of overlapping\n\nshields and vicious pike stabs.\n\n10 of the Orcs are Bow men.\n\nThey have Chainmail, Bucklers,  Longbows and hand axes.\n\nThey will creep round the back of the encampment and snipe from the\n\ntrees behind cover and concealment.\n\n\n\n9 of the orcs hold up the three standards, of the Tribe of the Bloody\n\nSevered Head and guard their leader.\n\nThey have Chainmail, Body shields, and Long swords.\n\nThe Tribes leader is an Orog called Grode, who wears Plate Mail and\n\nwields a Cold Iron Two Handed Sword.\n\nIf the battle is going really badly against the party and the Gnomes, you\n\nmay want to have a hidden contingent of Elven Ranges happen by...\n\n.............\n\nReward for the party and actually how you conduct this battle of 50 or\n\nso participants in wholly up to you the DM... \n\nIf the party do not deal with the Orcs now, it will be funny when they all\n\nstart pouring back into the Lair...\n\nLEVEL 3.\n\nThis level is nearly 170 feet below ground and has been carved out of\n\nthe soft rock. The walls have been mortared and the floor even tiled in\n\nplaces. The tunnels are between 7 and 8  feet high here and nicely\n\nstraight. They have been carved out of the earth and rock by orcs, and\n\nogres. Doors are thick and made of wood from the forest above. \n\nThe only light in the place comes from the fireplaces or from lamps the\n\ninhabitants may carry.\n\n\n\n\n\n1. OGRE ROOM.\n\nThis is a guard room where three ogres live. It has a 15 ft ceiling to give\n\nthe ogres room to swing their weapons. \n\nIt doesn’t stink as all the inhabitants of this level go outside when they\n\nneed to perform daily rituals. The Ogres are loyal to Abrax and keep the\n\nroom clean and their beds made.\n\nThey are all in here, either resting, eating, playing or arguing.\n\nThe Ogres are all dressed in well made clothes of blue cloth and wear\n\nwide brimmed hats. They are each armed with nicely made Large Mauls\n\nwhich they wield two handed : + 8 to hit 3d6 + 7 damage.\n\nThere is a curtained off area of tan curtains that hides three nicely\n\nmade ogre beds. Each ogre has a sack under his bed containing his\n\ntreasure.\n\nSack 1 : 42 gp, 12 sp and an elf brain in a glass jar.\n\nSack 2 : 30 gp and a dented dwarven helm.\n\nSack 3 : An eye carved from onyx (120gp) and 12 sp.\n\n2. THE LAB.\n\nThis is Abraxs lab for appraising and checking out magic items and\n\npotions. It contains basic lab test equipment and test rats in a basket.\n\nA brazier warms and lights the room. \n\nThere is no magic in this room. \n\n3. THE CELLS.\n\n\n\nThis is the dungeon of the dungeon. The room contains an unused table\n\nand chair. The barred cell doors are locked and Bill the Human Fighter\n\nhas the key. \n\nIn a ball in the corner of one of the cells lies a recently deceased \n\nGnome.\n\n4. THE LOUNGE.\n\nThis lounge is the domain of Sun and Bill. They will probably be alerted\n\nto the party when the party open the doors from 1. \n\nSun will drop a globe of darkness over the party and then they will both\n\nready actions to shoot their missile weapons and anyone who moves out\n\nof the globe. The two fighters are detailed in the NPC section.\n\nThe Lounge contains a merrily burning fire, two armchairs and a low\n\ntable. On the table is various drinking vessels and containers half filled\n\nwith mediocre alcoholic beverage.\n\n5. THE KITCHEN.\n\nThis is the Kitchen, it is loaded with wonderful foodstuffs. There are\n\nbarrels and sacks of yummy food and ales. There is fruit and nice\n\ncopper cookware. No expense has been spared to feed Abrax and his\n\nfriends. A door leads from the kitchen to a storeroom even more packed\n\nwith yummy goodies. A door leads from this room to a very clean and\n\nwell made well. Depending on the time of day, the humble servants may\n\nbe here preparing feasts. The servants are both cooks that were\n\nabducted from an inn somewhere. They were initially charmed and came\n\nhere of their own free will but now they are no better than slaves. They\n\nare drunk middle aged women (peasant 2) called Frumpton and Minger\n\nand are too scared to flee. \n\n6. HUMBLE SERVANTS QUARTERS.\n\n\n\nThese humble quarters contain nothing more than two crude beds, a\n\nnight table and a wardrobe that contains the humble peasant belongings\n\nthat they hastily packed. \n\nThe room reeks of booze and it is evident that the women have started\n\ndipping into the ale in an effort to block out the pain of their servitude.\n\n7. ABRAXS ROOM.\n\nThe door to this room is reinforced with steel bands. If Abrax is aware\n\nthe party is after him then he has barred the door and is fleeing up the\n\nstairs, leaving the escape door open to show his escape route.\n\nThe room is the finest in the dungeon. He room contains a large and\n\nluxurious bed, a small table, a closet and a chamber pot.\n\nIn the closet is a large amount of fine clothes and a jewelry box. This\n\nbox is locked and it is empty. \n\nA fine rug decorates the floor and a door in the south leads to a rickety\n\nwooden stairway that climbs around 160 feet up and out a secret and\n\nhidden trapdoor, to the forest above.\n\n8. SECRET TREASURE ROOM.\n\nThis is Abraxs secret treasure room. \n\nThe sliding stone door can be found in the wall with a DC 20 search\n\ncheck. \n\nA stone plug hides a keyhole. Abrax has the only key and the wall is one\n\nfoot thick. The DC to pick the lock is 30.\n\nMany Traps and treasures lie within.\n\n\n\nTrap: A Trip wire across the doorway sets of a spring loaded scything\n\nblade at chest level.\n\nBlade strikes at + 10 for 3d4 Crit X4  .\n\nSearch: DC 20 to see the trip wire and then the scythe. \n\nDisable: DC 22- Or it can be triggered harmlessly.\n\nTrap: A Trip wire across the floor in front of the chest triggers a 300lb\n\nstone block to fall from the ceiling and bash in the head of the person\n\nby the chest.\n\nBlock bashes for 8d6 damage and could knock a PC out or put him into a\n\ncoma at the DMs whim.\n\nReflex DC 20 to leap back out of the way of the block.\n\nSearch: DC 20 to see the trip wire or the slight square shape in the\n\nceiling. \n\nDisable: DC 22- Or it can be triggered harmlessly.\n\nThe Chest: The chest is made of solid iron and well locked ( DC 30).\n\nThe lock is also trapped with a poison needle.\n\nTrap: A sharp needle shoots from the lock as soon as a pick is put in.\n\nHits at + 10 for 1 dam. The needle is poisoned with Drow Knockout\n\npoison. DC 13 or fall unconscious. One minute later another save must be\n\nmade or the poisoned PC remains unconscious for 2d4 hours.\n\nSearch: DC 20 to see tiny trap in there.\n\nDisable: DC 20- Or it can be triggered harmlessly with some ingenious\n\nmethod. \n\nTreasure: Hopefully there is someone still alive after all those traps...\n\nThe chest has a tray on the top over the other treasure. This cannot be\n\nseen unless the gold is searched. The tray contains 1000 gp and a Gold\n\nBug swarm ( See Monsters).\n\n\n\nThe actual treasure besides the 1000 gp on top is below and consists of\n\n2000 gp, a grape sized ruby worth 5000gp, three polished human skulls\n\nand a baby black dragons skull. \n\nDEVELOPMENT.\n\nAbrax and his son will most likely be at the top of the stairs and waiting\n\nfor the party with his Charmed Ogre Madrad. \n\nOn contact with the party he will ask them to leave peacefully as he\n\nwouldn’t want anything permanent to happen to such as aspiring bunch of\n\nadventuring do gooders. \n\nIf they try to rush up the stairs he will cast a bunch of spells own upon\n\nthe players and/or enhancements upon Madrad and then have Madrad\n\npush the big boulder they have up there down on them.

They are most often found in stranded funeral\n\nbarges or in the area where the ritual was never completed. They hate\n\nlife, and will attack any living creature that disturbs them.\n\n   A coffer corpse appears much as it did in life. Its clothes hang in\n\nshreds and its skin is dry, brittle, and drawn tightly over its bones. Its\n\nhands end in sharp claws with long nails.\n\nCOMBAT\n\nA coffer corpse attacks using its claws. It will attempt to grab a foe\n\naround the throat and will not release its grip until either it or its victim\n\nis dead.\n\n   Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, the coffer corpse must hit an\n\nopponent of up to Large size with both claw attacks. If it gets a hold, it\n\nuses its death grip.\n\n   Death Grip (Ex): A coffer corpse deals 1d4+4 points of damage per\n\nround with a successful grapple check against a Large or smaller\n\ncreature. Because the coffer corpse grasps the victim’s throat, a\n\ncreature in its grasp cannot speak or cast spells with verbal components.\n\n   A creature caught can hold its breath for a number of rounds equal to\n\nits Constitution score. After this time, the character must succeed at a\n\nConstitution check (DC 10) in order to continue holding its breath. The\n\ncheck must be repeated each round, and the DC increases by 1 for each\n\nprevious success. If the victim runs out of breath, she falls unconscious\n\n\n\n(0 hp), and begins taking suffocation damage. (See page 88 of the\n\nDMG).\n\n   Illusory Death (Ex): In any round a coffer corpse is struck for 6 or\n\nmore points of damage by a single non-magical weapon, it will slump to\n\nthe ground as if dead. If it has fastened its death grip on a victim, the\n\nvictim falls as well, unless a successful Reflex save (DC 12) is made.\n\nEven if the save is made, the coffer corpse does not release its grip but,\n\nrather, slumps against its opponent’s body.\n\n   On its next turn the coffer corpse rises again as if through\n\nreanimation. Any creature viewing this must succeed at a Will save (DC\n\n10) or become panicked for 2d4 rounds.\n\n   Weapon Immunity (Ex): A coffer corpse takes half damage from all\n\npiercing and slashing weapons.\n\n   Undead: Immune to mind-influencing effects, poison, sleep, paralysis,\n\nstunning, and disease. Not subject to critical hits, subdual damage,\n\nability damage, energy drain, or death from massive damage.

These playful, benign creatures have magical\n\npowers that they can share with others, so they are often sought as\n\ncompanions.\n\nPseudodragons resemble miniature red dragons. They have fine scales\n\nand sharp horns and teeth. A pseudodragon's coloration is red-brown as\n\nopposed to the deep red of red dragons. Its tail is about 2 feet long\n\n(longer than the pseudodragon itself), barbed, and very flexible.\n\nPseudodragons communicate via a limited form of telepathy. If one\n\nelects to take a human companion, it can transmit what it sees and hears\n\nat a distance of up to 240 yards. Pseudodragons can vocalize animal\n\n\n\nnoises such as a rasping purr (pleasure), a hiss (unpleasant surprise), a\n\nchirp (desire), or a growl (anger).\n\nCombat: The pseudodragon can deliver a vicious bite with its small,\n\ndragonlike jaws, but its major weapon is its sting-equipped tail. The\n\ncreature can move it with flashing speed and strikes at +6 on attack\n\nrolls. Any creature struck Make a DC 16 save or go into a state of\n\ncatalepsy that lasts 1-6 days. The victim appears quite dead, but at the\n\nend of that time the character will either wake up unharmed (75%\n\nchance) or die (25% chance).\n\nPseudodragons have a chameleonlike power that allows them to alter\n\ntheir coloration to blend with their surroundings. They can blend into any\n\ntypical forest background with an 80% chance of being undetected by\n\ncreatures which cannot see invisible objects. Pseudodragons have\n\ninfravision with a 60 foot range and can see invisible objects.\n\nA pseudodragon is highly magic resistant and can transmit this magic\n\nresistance to its human companion via physical contact (a pseudodragon\n\nlikes to be perched on the top of one's head or curled around the\n\nshoulders and upper back).\n\nHabitat/Society: These forest-dwelling creatures place their lairs in the\n\nhollows of great trees or in large caves.\n\nA pseudodragon will very rarely take a human or demihuman as its\n\ncompanion. Some view these pseudodragons as the human's pet; the\n\npseudodragon will be sure to correct this misunderstanding. There are\n\ntwo ways to become a pseudodragon's companion; one is to use magic to\n\nsummon it (a find familiar spell). Another way is to find the\n\npseudodragon on an adventure and pursuade it to become a companion.\n\nThe pseudodragon that searches for companionship will stalk a candidate\n\nsilently for days, reading his thoughts via telepathy, judging his deeds to\n\nbe good or evil. If the candidate is found to be good, the pseudodragon\n\nwill present itself to the human as a traveling companion and observe the\n\nhuman's reaction. If the human seems overjoyed and promises to take\n\n\n\nvery good care of it, the pseudodragon will accept. If not, it will fly\n\naway.\n\nThe personality of a pseudodragon has been described by some as\n\ncatlike. A pseudodragon is willing to serve, provided that it is well-fed,\n\ngroomed, and receives lots of attention. At times a pseudodragon seems\n\narrogant, demanding, and less than willing to help. In order to gain its\n\nfull cooperation, the companion must pamper the pseudodragon and\n\nmake it feel as though it were the most important thing in his life. If the\n\npseudodragon is mistreated or insulted it will leave, or worse, play\n\npranks when least expected. Pseudodragons particularly dislike cruelty\n\nand will not serve cruel masters.\n\nEcology: Pseudodragons are omnivorous but prefer to eat meat. Their\n\ndiet consists chiefly of rodents and small birds with occasional leaves,\n\nfruits, and berries. In the wild, pseudodragons live solitary lives,\n\nprotecting small personal hoards in their nests. They gather to mate\n\nonce per year, in early spring, when gatherings of dozens of\n\npseudodragons are not uncommon. After mating, males and females\n\nseparate; females lay speckled brown eggs in clutches of four to six\n\nwhich hatch in mid-summer; females raise the young by themselves.\n\nPseudodragons hibernate in winter; the young leave the nest in spring to\n\nmate.\n\nPseudodragons have a lifespan of 10-15 years. Like dragons, they are\n\nattracted to bright shiny objects. Pseudodragon eggs can be resold for\n\nup to 10,000 gold pieces while a hatchling is worth as much as 20,000\n\ngold pieces\n\nNPCS \n\nName: Abbrax ( The Scarily Evil )  \n\nSize:   M                    \n\nRace/Sex: Male human 29 yrs old.\n\n\n\nClass/Level: Wizard ( Enchanter ) 6\n\nAlignment:   LE         \n\nHit Points.  58\n\nInitiative:  Dagger + 3 Or Spell + 1\n\nSpeed: 30\n\nArmor Class: \n\nAttacks: 1 dagger stab + 4 : 1D4 +1 Crit 19-20 x2\n\nBase Att: +3\n\nSaves:   Fort :+ 7    Ref: + 3  Will: + 5 \n\n Abilities:    Str 12   Dex 13  Con 20  Int 16  Wis 11  Chr 17   \n\nSkills:     Spellcraft + 10, Notice + 5,  Stealth + 4.\n\nBluff + 10, Diplomacy + 10, Concentration + 12\n\nFeats and Class abilities: Dodge, Run, Spell focus - Enchantment,\n\nToughness, Extend Spell.\n\nLanguages:   Common, Giant, Orc, Elven, Undercommon.\n\nSpells :4/4/4/3.\n\n0- Flare, Light, Dancing Lights, Daze.\n\n1st - Color spray, Silent Image, Charm Person, Ray of Enfeeblement,\n\nSleep, Hypnotism. \n\n2nd.- Hideous laughter, Mirror Image, Web, Fog cloud.\n\n3rd.- Hold Person, Deep Slumber, Heroism, Rage.\n\nEquipment: Abbrax wears fine purple and blue silk courtly clothes.\n\n\n\nHe wears a small backpack containing His spell book with the listed\n\nspells within.

This could be a difficult adventure to run, so give it\na thorough read through and don’t attempt it unless you are a Dungeon\nMaster of at least 15th level.  \nThe adventure is designed for a party of 2nd or 3rd level adventurers.\nBut of course can be modified to suit your group using your 15th level\nDMing skills.

I have used Mulmaster for this adventure but any neutral or evil\nport city will do. Mysteries of the Moonsea would be useful for this\nadventure if you set it in Mulmaster, but not essential. \nA note on Mulmaster: Mulmaster is a predominantly evil place filled\nwith evil people. It is a decadent sprawl riddled with crime and\ncorruption. Mulmasterites believe their neighbors plot against them\nand the city has long felt isolated from the rest of the Moonsea.\nAdventurers are generally viewed as interlopers and fools, whose lofty\nideas are more likely to get them killed than accomplish anything. -\nMysteries of the Moonsea.\n\nIn front of the players spreads the dock area, where the docks and\njetties of the harbor jut out into the Moonsea. Here, an interesting\nmixture of warehouses, businesses and homes creates an air of\nconstant bustle and variety, a seeming haven to travelers and\nforeigners within this natural fort of a city. For, a natural fort it is, as\nthe mountain range hugs Mulmaster, protecting it to the south while\nthe great Moonsea itself guards its northern boundaries. The night and\nthe air is clear, as a salty breeze blows into the city from the sea.\nIn the distance and outside of the city one can hear the soothing\nsound of the sea as it caresses the beach, shuffling sand and crabs\nbefore it as it rolls gently along the shoreline. Looking out across the\ngrand city of Mulmaster, one can easily see the spires and walls of the\nnobles homes and castles lit by candles, torches and magical lights\nalong a piece of land known as the Towers of the Blade. The whole city\n\n\n\nis built upon the slopes of a mountain range, and the quality of the\narchitecture slides with that natural grade. The further down one goes\nfrom the Towers of the Blade, the more common and, eventually,\nramshackle the domiciles become. \n\nThe fort guarding the road into the city itself is an impressive\nstructure of impassive, hard granite. It stands like a forbidding giant\nbefore the city gates in the south, ready to deny any plunder of\nMulmaster's riches. Dark walls tower above the road and, looking up;\nyou can easily see the outline of archers walking their length.\n\nUpon disembarking from the boat, the players are accosted by two of\nthe harbor guards.(N human warrior 3) They are grey bearded old\nsalty sea dog types who are paid by the city to check arrivals by\nquestioning. There is also an entry tax of one gold coin for non\nresidents. If the players cannot pay this and still want to enter they\ncould pawn or sell an item. Questions they will ask the players are the\nfollowing.\n\n-Place of origin?\n\n   - Reason for visiting and proposed length of stay?\n\n-If they are carrying any powerful magic?\n\n-If any among them is a spell caster above the rank of Conjurer?\n(That means 4th level or above by the old 1st edition rules).\n\nAny PC answering yes to this last question will be advised to join the\nBrotherhood of the Cloak, the powerful wizard group of the city.\nAnyone who chooses not to join and is then caught casting a spell is\ndealt with harshly; penalties include torture, maiming and often death.\nIf you are running this adventure with wizards higher than 3rd level\nthen this part if for you the DM to sort out.\n\nThe harbor guards are tired old drunkards and are easily bribed, to\nlook the other way if any difficulty arises. \n\n\n\nINTO THE CITY.\n\nIt is midsummer and the snow from the surrounding mountains has\nmostly melted. There are puddles on the muddy streets as well as\nrunning in rivulets off the houses and along the gutters. There are a\nfew people about and the city has a hurried, blaming atmosphere,\nwhich you can feel as you walk about the docks.\n\nTHE NEEDELED HEART. \n\nThe first thing of interest the PCs see is a tattoo parlor. A salty sign\ndepicting a heart with a needle piercing it, swings above the door. A\ngathering of rough looking sailors gather around and on the three\nshort steps leading up to the door. They will see the PCs and target\nthen for abuse and ridicule. One of the sailors will flick his pipe full of\nburning ash out at the nearest player and then they will leap forward\nas one, to bash and steal.\n\nThere are five LE Human Pirate 1, armed with whacking sticks and two\nLE human Pirate 2, armed with rusty cutlasses. \n\nAfter two rounds of combat Hangis, (CG Human Fighter 5) the owner\nof the shop, will burst forth with his two handed stick of whacking\nwhich he is a master of and will lay about with it beating and scattering\nthe pirates as he yells at them for being bilge water spawned\nbarnacles.\n\nThe pirates will flee as soon as it looks like they are losing.\n\nHangis will invite the PCs into the shop for tattooing once the pirates\nare gone.\n\nTHE MINSTREL.\n\n\n\nA raggedly looking minstrel hails the PCs. (LE Bard 3) He has a\nbattered lute and its’ discordant strumming resonates throughout the\nstreet. He wears minstrel clothes that were once bright but are now\nfaded and grime spattered. His name is Bezzin and he is a member of\nthe Hard Drinking, Fighting Pirates: a loose confederation of street\ngangs, thieves, thugs, and outcasts of all sorts.\n\n Despite his dirty appearance he is singing a well constructed epic tale\nof a Paladin called Wyn the Younger and his part in leading Midnight to\nascendancy during the Time of troubles. He will beg donations into his\nshabby old hat on the conclusion of his tale, and then try to sell the\nplayers a magical lucky charm, for 500 gold coins or other treasures of\nequal value. The charm is a silver leprechaun figurine and will allow a\nre-roll of a “1” once per week. The DM chooses which “1” through the\nweek is re-rolled. The charm radiates powerful Divine Fey magic if\ndetected for.\n\nAs the players are walking away he will create the illusory sound of him\nlaunching into another tale. This will give him a + 5 on his Slight of\nhand check when he cuts a PCs purse, steals the charm back or some\nhow rips them off as they head off. His base Slight of hand is + 10. If\ncaught or threatened in any way he will use a combination of barding\nsinging and pitiful begging in an attempt to calm the PCs.\n\nThe players may roam the city shopping and loitering, without further\nincident. The weather is uncharacteristically warm for Mulmaster.\n\nAs it gets darker and more nighttime the PCs may wish to find a\nTavern. \n\nTHE OX PIT.\n\n\n\nThe tavern they find is called The Ox Pit. Famous for its rough and\ntumble atmosphere, it is known for its ale and its roasted Ox. A room\nand a meal costs 7gp. - Mysteries of the Moonsea \n\nThe tavern is crowded and quite old and the smell of spilt ale and\nroasted meat fills the air. A skinny scabby looking barman will rudely\nignore any spell caster looking PCs.\n\nAny PC looking around and making a spot check DC 15 will see a large\nclean skinned and yellow bearded man with a long mane of blond hair.\nHe wears a grey leather trench coat and a brown knitted woolen\nsweater with matching leather pants. He is playing with a silver amulet\nand looking around the room. His gaze settles on a group of swordsmen\nat a table in the corner and he goes over to them.\n\nAsk the players what they do.\n\nAfter a few moments of this yellow-maned man talking with the\nswordsmen, they seem to refuse whatever he is offering them and he\nsits back at his booth and scans the room again, frustratedly fiddling\nwith his amulet.\n\nHe then looks at the PCs and comes over to them.\n\nDM note: This is Leon the Lion Heart. He is a paladin of freedom and\nhe is scanning the crowd using his detect evil power, to find a group of\ngood or neutral people to help him. The amulet is what he is using as a\ncover so no one knows he is a paladin and can detect good. If none of\nthe players are good or neutral then Leon does not approach them and\nthe adventure ends here. The amulet is actually a holy symbol of\nTymora but he never lets anyone see all of it. He holds it covered by\nmost of his hand, and when it is not in use he tucks it away.\n\nLEON.\n\nHe smiles, pulls up a chair and buys himself a large ale. He is just about\nto say something when a wild haired drunken maniac sailor crashes into\n\n\n\nhim, spilling the ale all over the nearest player. Leon grabs the sailor\nand squints at him for a second, (detecting the evil in the sailor)\nbefore nodding to the PCs and dragging the struggling swearing sailor\nout side for a fight!\n\nConduct this fight between the drunken (-4 to attack rolls skill checks,\nability checks and reflex saves. But he has 6 temporary hit points)\nsailor (Human LE Pirate3) and Leon. No weapons are used in the first\nround but on round two the sailor pulls out a rusty fish gutting knife!\nAnd Leon disarms him (or attempts to) in a flourish of street fighting\nstyle.\n\nIn the unlikely event of Leon being killed here, the adventure ends and\nhis body is looted by the onlookers before being rolled into the gutter.\n\nAfter Leon delivers the final devastating head butt, driving the bad\nsailor to the cobbles he heads back inside and resumes drinking. Once\nsettled again he turns to the PCs and says “My little buddy here *taps\namulet* says you may be willing to help me, and if you are currently in\nsearch of riches you may be wanting to help me.”\n\nHe explains that his name is Leon and he is a retired adventurer. Now\nhe makes weapons and sells them to some temples and some\nadventurers. To this he adds in a whisper “By some temples I mean\ngood temples and by some adventurers I mean good adventurers.”\n\n He just had a crate of 40 magical throwing knives made at great\nexpense and two nights ago they were stolen by the Night Masks: A\nband of thieves, assassins and enforcers who operate largely by night,\nthey are mainly established in Westgate. They are led by a being known\nonly as the Faceless and a handful of merchants, who take to calling\nthemselves the Night Masters. The guild, whose symbol is a domino\nmask, quickly came to control most of the illegal doings in that city and\nhave started to organize the freelance rogues of Mulmaster, although\n\n\n\nthe Hard Drinking, Fighting Pirates: a loose confederation of street\ngangs, thieves, thugs, and outcasts of all sorts is resisting assimilation.\n\nHe managed to find out (by paying some people and threatening others)\nthat his knives were sold to a team of pirate smugglers who are leaving\ntomorrow morning for Calunt ( Or other nearby port city) to sell their\nstolen cargo. He wants to get onto the ship, grab his stuff quietly and\nget off as quickly as possible. For the quick and efficient search of the\nship he needs help. \n\nHe is offering one of the following to anyone who helps him.\n\nHe will make masterwork weapons for them: either 4 small,\n2 medium or 1 large weapon. These will be crafted to have a + 1 attack\nbonus or a + 1 damage bonus of the players choice. It will also be\ncrafted in the style the player specifies. \n\n−He will offer 350 gold coins of Mulmaster mint, in a yellow satin\nbag.\n\n−He will offer training in weapon smithing or unarmed combat.\n\n−He will offer one of the magical throwing knives. \n\nOr \n\n−He will offer to perform 2 days of work for them in the non evil\nand non gay way of their choosing.\n\nOne of the above choices will be paid to each player upon successful\ncompletion of the mission. If the mission is unsuccessful there will be\nno payment at all. He explains “There can be no ideas of getting caught\nor doing a half done job in this city, it’s a tough city, only the lions and\nthe snakes survive, and even they have a hard time.”\n\nLEONS HOUSE.\n\n\n\nIf they accept he will take them through the streets and up a hill to a\nnice moderately posh neighborhood, with clean cobble streets and tall\nbrick houses with gardens on their roofs. The night is cool, clear and\ncomfortable, a fine evening for strolling down the boulevards or sitting\nout on a veranda for a glass of chilled wine as some people seem to be\ndoing in this district. \n\nThe area is patrolled by small but powerful groups of watchmen who\nare well paid to keep this area safe and crime free. A group moves to\nintercept the party but they nod and move on when they recognize\nLeon.\n\nLeon’s house is tall and thin and he is met at the door by Jeeves- his\nold butler and Jemima- his Thayan cook. \n\nHe has them fix food and beds for all. \n\nHe wakes the players about 3 hours before dawn. So it seems that the\nplayer’s heads have just hit the pillow before they are awoken.\n\nSome of the players may be fatigued (especially if they had a tough\nday previously) as they can only get about 4 hours sleep. Spell casters\nwill only have the spells they had remaining from the day before. He\ntakes the PCs down into the secret workshop / basement where he has\na few random masterwork weapons that the PCs can borrow. He also\ndoes not recommend anyone carry too much or wear heavy armor,\nexplaining that swimming will take place at one point.\n\nUP AND OUT.\n\nAfter a quick breakfast of apples and porridge he grabs two back\npacks and two large sacks and leads the players out into the foggy dark\nstreets.\n\nLeon is wearing a very dark blue suit of finely made leather armor,\nembroidered with tiny crimson lions on the left sleeve and has a finely\n\n\n\nmade dark grey handled broadsword with a lion headed pommel\nstrapped to his back.\n\nUnnoticed by any authorities the PCs follow Leon through the twisting\nalleys, passing the occasional passed out drunk beggar,  until he lifts\naside a large manhole and motions for them to follow him down into the\nsewers. Once the PCs have climbed down the rusty iron ladder they\nfind themselves in the dark, until Leon blazes up a tinder twig and from\nthat, a torch.\n\nTHE SEWERS.\n\nMulmaster, like most cities, contains a massive sewer system beneath\nthe city. Like many other cities, the sewers quickly became a favored\nway to travel unseen throughout the city by those conducting business\nthat city officials would frown upon. - Mysteries of the Moonsea\n\nThe sewer system is a maze of tunnels and rooms that mostly serve as\nlairs for monsters. The main sewage tunnels are 15 feet wide, with a 5-\nfoot wide walkway on either side of the 10 foot wide and 10 foot deep\ntrench through which waste water and sewage flows. Bridges made of\nmetal grating cross over the sewage in some areas. Exposure to the\nfilthy sewer water could cause a disease if the DM chooses. \n\nLeon leads the party along the stinky grimy mucky sewer for about 100\nyards, on the path along side the sluggishly moving stream of muck.\nLadders, pipes and passages are passed on both sides. \n\nHe Says ” If we see any Night Masks, just calmly walk by.”\n\nSKELETON ROGUE BATTLE.\n\nHe has just finished this sentence when a Clashing and Crashing is\nheard from up ahead. Two dark clothed and spry looking figures, (LE\nHuman rogue 3) are fighting a losing battle against a crowd of eight\n\n\n\nrusty weapon wielding muck covered skeletons on the ledge/path\nahead. There is a loud crack as one of the thieves gets a skeletons\nrusty mace in the side of the head and cartwheels weakly into the\nsewer. The other rogue spots the light and screams for help. He\nwhacks a skeleton in the ribs with his rapier but it does nearly nothing.\n\nLeon is holding his amulet and watching the man. He blocks the path\nand motions for the PCs to stay back and not interfere. Moments later\nthe rogue is overwhelmed and driven, crushed and dying to the ground.\nThe skeletons tramp over him and head toward the party. Leon holds\nhis amulet forth and silently calls down its power to drive the\nskeletons away. If this does not work he and the players will have to\nbattle them.\n\nDM note: As stated previously, the amulet is non magical and does\nnothing by itself. Here Leon is secretly using his paladin turn undead\npowers.\n\nSHUFFLING ALONG.\n\nBy now the players would be completely lost within the twisting turns\nof the sewer system. Leon however knows the way perfectly. After\ntraveling for about ten minutes without anything more interesting than\ntwo freshly killed giant rats (examination will reveal that the rats were\nkilled by short bow arrows, which were then removed), and a bloated\nnear naked body, bobbing face down in the grimy water, the players will\nhear a plink, plink sound from one of the pipes. \n\nTHE JOR.\n\nA commando team of two Jor (See appendix) have set up an ambush\nhere. The plinking sound is a carefully designed diversion.\n\n\n\nThey both have 20 hp and have rusty scale mail, bucklers and\nscimitars. Their hide in the murky waters is + 6 and Move silently is +\n5.\n\nThe lead one will pop up and fire at anyone looking down the pipe, using\nhis poison sneak attack. The other one will fire at the PCs from 60 ft\ndown the tunnel. Both of the Jor are ¾ hidden in the sewer water and\nshould be very difficult to fight. If the fight turns against them they\nwill dive under the water and sneak away.\n\nSUPER GOBLIN AMBUSH.\n\nAfter continuing through the sewers a ways, Leon says “We are almost\nthere.” Then he crouches in readiness as a strange dying sound is\nheard from up ahead. \n\nThis sound is made by a cunningly concealed goblin (Bunzwik the Power\nGoblin to be exact) wailing through the elaborate pipe systems of the\nsewers. As the players creep forward, the cunning Bunzwik will burst\nfrom his hidden cubby kicking out at the weakest looking PC. That PC\nwill have to make a spot check DC 20 to see him exploding forth. If\nseen, the rush to send the PC into the sewer can be resisted on an\nopposed check vs. his bulrush attempt or a reflex save DC 14. If\nBunzwik the Power Goblin is not seen at all, the player must make a\nreflex save DC 20 or go flying into the sewer.\n\nBunzwik will then whistle and his mangy wolf will come bounding down\nthe path from behind the PCs. The wolf was hiding in a pipe back a\nways.\n\nBunzwik will also fire his loaded crossbow into the face of the nearest\nPC, or the PC he was rushing if that PC did not go into the sewer. A\nbrutal fight will ensue with the goblin in the middle and the wolf\nnipping at the players from the back. If badly hurt, Bunzwik the power\ngoblin will try to back away telling the PCs that they have passed his\n\n\n\ntest and he may help them when they least expect it at some time in\nthe future. Leon will tell the players to let this honorable goblin go. If\nBunzwik is killed, Leon will take the gold and agate ring he wears.\n\nIf anyone has been badly hurt in the fight Leon will use his Paladin Lay\non hands healing ability to heal them. \n\nAfter he gives his prayers of freedom to Tymora, he explains to the\nPCs that he is actually a paladin of Freedom and has been secretly\njudging them all along. He shows them his holy symbol and explains that\nis was just a trick so he can keep his paladin powers secret in this\nhorrid evil city.\n\nTHE BLACK AND BLUE LASS.\n\nThe party comes to a large pipe with sea sounds and sea smells from\nthe sea shore issuing from it- a salty and refreshing change from the\nslimy sewers. He asks if someone would scout surely ahead to make\nsure the coast is safe. If anyone has anything that water would ruin, to\nleave it here as now they will be swimming a ways.\n\nAfter 20 feet of crawling, the pipe ends underneath a wharf. Leon\njumps out and starts swimming strongly through the cold dark salty\nseawater, towards a huge and terrifying galleon, bristling with gun\nhatches and vicious barnacles. The wooden pillars that support the\nwharf are spaced 20 feet apart and the players must swim through the\nfreezing water with attendant penalties from the cold, to each of\nthese, on the way to the galleon. \nA solitary early morning fisherman (LE Human Commoner 3) must be\navoided; by dodging behind a pillar (DC 5 hide check).If the players are\nseen he offers them a lift in his boat. If the players get in, he will row\nthem around to the side of the galleon furthest from the wharf and\nyell up to the pirates “These guys were sneaking toward your ship!”\n\n\n\nWhat ever happens then is up to the DM. May I suggest a huge old\nrusty cannon hurled over the ships side and down onto the players,\nbooshing them and sending the boat to down to the Davey Jonsey\ndepths.\n\nIf the players make it to the final pillar (pillar number three and only\n10 feet from the huge moored galleon), Leon will take a glowing purple\npotion from a pouch around his neck and quaff it. He will then use its\nmagic to climb like a spider up the side of the ship and into an open\nport hole. Seconds later a knotted rope is fired down and he beckons\nthe PCs up. The DC to climb this rope is 4. But as the PCs have\nprobably removed their shoes their feet my be slashed to ribbons by\nthe cruel and unforgiving barnacles...\n\nINSIDE THE LASS\n\nThe players find themselves in the ships galley, bundles of food hang\nall over the place and there are many sharp kitchen knives as well as\nrolling pins and cleavers. \n\nLeon sneakily leads the players down a windy wooden stair toward the\nbottom of the boat. Snoring can be heard from behind doors that lead\nalong a thin passage that ends at the ships store room.\n\nSuch is the pirates’ confidence that the room is not guarded and as\nlong as the players are quiet they will not be spotted. The heavy\nwooden storeroom door is locked and unless one of the PCs can open it\nLeon will have to bust it open with his crowbar- this has a good 27 %\nchance of waking the 10 sleeping pirates (LE Human Pirate 2) that lie\nheavily hung-over in the nearby bunk rooms. If woken one will stagger\nand lurch out of his hammock to see what the noise is. Upon spotting\nthe busted door he will yell for help and the rest of the badly hung\nover pirates (With any penalties you wish to give them) will stagger and\nlurch out of their hammocks to fight the PCs. If the going goes badly\nthey will run, yelling and alerting the ship. If the whole ship of 100 or\n\n\n\nso pirates is alerted and brought to bear on the players you may as well\nhave them just hand over their characters and pass out new blank\nsheets.\n\nTHE STOREROOM.\n\nThe cramped storeroom is full of boxes and bags of goods and bads,\nstolen and otherwise. \n\nLeon will start wrenching things open in search of his throwing knives\nand encourage the PCs to do also. Finding the knives requires 11 rounds\nor a search check of 25 – which ever comes first. There is too much\njunk on top of the crate of knives to be able to spot it though a detect\nmagic in the first 3 rounds of searching, but after 3 rounds of moving\njunk about the glimmer of magic can be seen. The other Items in the\nroom are;\n\nFine dinnerware of silver, pewter and copper.\n\nLarge and gothic paintings of dark surreal seascapes. \n\nMasterwork small shields.\n\nCrates of fine short swords.\n\nCrates of masterwork halberd and pike heads.\n\nCrates of masterwork ring and scale mail. \n\nStacks of 30lb silver ingots, stamped with the symbol of a spiked\nsun with an evil face.\n\nRolls of bear furs.\n\nBundles of masterwork woolen blankets of light blue embroidered\nwith a black unicorn killing a white unicorn in a horrid and bloody\ndisplay.\n\nCrates of Masterwork daggers.\n\nAND finally the crate of 40 magical throwing knives- THE FLYING\n\n\n\nCLAWS OF THE LUCKY LION. Detailed in the appendix.\n\nESCAPE FROM THE BLACK AND BLUE LASS.\n\nIf the party make into and out of the storeroom and up to the galley and\ndown their rope unseen and undetected through the entire mission then\nthey won’t be being chased. \n\nIn the likely event that they are being chased, they will hit the water and\nrealize that there are a bunch of harpoon and rusty cutlass wielding\npirates screaming “YARRRRRR!” at them from the sides of the ship while\nanother bunch is lowering a long boat.\n\nThe sailors will throw two harpoons at the players as they swim to the\nrelative safety of the below wharf area. The wickedness and the power\nof these harpoons and their ability to hook into the players and drag\nthem back toward the ship foot by painful foot is up to the DM. At the\nDMs option the Pirate captain “Spack Jarrow” may be leading his men and\nshoot a harpoon at the players getting the full benefit of his “Cannons\nDemon” special ability.\n\nAs the party nears the pipe leading back into the sewers the longboat\nsplashes down and a boatload of jeering and evilly “Yo Ho Hoing” wicked\npirates row hard in pursuit of the players.\n\nThe long boat contains one LE Human Pirate 4, three LE Human Pirate 2,\nand eight LE Human and Half Orc Pirate 1. they are armed with a few\nlight crossbows, cutlasses, and the leader has a shiny red +2 knife\nclenched between his teeth, making it quite hard for him to yell out\norders. \n\nBarring any critically failed swim checks, the party should make it to the\npipe with the pirates still in pursuit.\n\nOnce the party gain the pipe Leon empties a bag of sharp and rusty\ncaltrops into the pipe to slow the pursuers.\n\n\n\nHe then blazes up a torch and leads them jogging onward into the sewers\nin escape from the pirates. Surprised Pirate screaming is soon heard\nfunneling out of the pipe and echoing through the sewers.\n\nTHE CONJURER. \n\nAfter a short while a strange looking fat man (Balgur the CN Human\nConjurer 6), with a shock of red hair and a blue painted face emerges\nfrom a side tunnel. He is holding up a green wooden staff with a brightly\nglowing yellow crystal on the end, illuminating him in his outfit of weird\norange jacket and balloon style multi colored foreign pants. He has many\nflashy rings and necklaces and will seem overly friendly in his dealings\nwith the party. \n\nHe asks why the party is jogging along briskly and suggests they stay and\nface whatever it is they are fleeing from. He tells the party that he is\ndown here hunting Bullywugs for the bounty on their tongues.  (Which is\n15 coins of gold per tongue). He is possessed of a ¼ staff +2 which is\nensorcelled to shed light on command up to three times per day. He has\ntwo potions of extra healing as well.\n\nHe has a mouse familiar which gives him alertness and a + 6 to move\nsilently and he has created two new spells, Burning Grease and Summon\nPecks which the players may get to see him cast a little down the path.\nThey are detailed in the Appendix.\n\nHe will join the party here to keep them safe from their enemies. Leon\nagrees saying we need all the help we can to get out of this place.\n\nBULLYWUG AMBUSH.\n\nThe bullywugs enraged at Balgurs hunting of them are waiting in ambush\nfor him. He is with the party and so the party gets ambushed too. \n\nTen Bullywugs will burst out of the sewer water, leaping up onto the walk\nway in an evil frog like way. The spot DC is 22 to not be surprised by this.\n\n\n\nOne will land in front of each party member and any left over will land on\nthe left and right of the party and attack from there. They will beat\ndown on the party croaking hideously. Balgur will shout in glee and cast his\nspells in an effort to take down as many as he can at once. He does not\ncare if he endangers the players as he is chaotic neutral.\n\nIf any Bullywugs are killed he takes a moment to cut out its tongue and\nstash it away. If any of the players challenge him for the tongues he will\ntry to intimidate them and threaten them. Leon will say “Let him have the\nbounty - it is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than\nfor a rich man to enter the paradise of the gods”.\n\nBalgur will reply “Yes but while it may be difficult for a camel to pass\nthrough the eye of a needle, it is still possible. It just takes a pot of\ngrease and a lot of pushing.”\n\nWhen half of their number is killed, the Bullywugs will flee and Balgur will\nrun after them, thus leaving the party. If they are all killed he gathers\nup the tongues and then leaves anyway...  laughing insanely.\n\nTHE BOX.\n\nOn a spot check DC 21 a player may see a sealed wooden box floating\ndown the sewer. If fished from the sewer and opened it will be\ndiscovered to contain a bright yellow suit of Gnome or Halfling-sized\nmasterwork leather armor and two square packets of something sealed\nin red wax with a windmill seal imprint on it. These are food rations. While\nthey look and smell perfect in every way they are cursed rotten food,\nblearch ! One hour after being eaten the food will force a fort save DC\n15 on the player. If it is made the player will only suffer ten minutes of\nblindness and a horrid sick feeling. If it is failed the player will go blind\nand be confused for half an hour before dying of food poisoning. \n\nThere is also a small gnomish book of the religious ceremonies of the\ngood gnomish gods. It is written in gnome of course.\n\n\n\nTHE RAT. \n\nOn a spot check DC 5 a player may see a few burned giant rats floating\nface down in the sewer.\n\nTHE GRAFFITI.\n\nThe players will see the words “Nightmasks forever!” painted in red paint\non the wall. The words are surrounded by a number of domino masks and\nthey lead down one branch of the sewer.     \n\nSuddenly echoing down that sewer branch, the players hear a high\npitched squeal- suddenly cut short.\n\nThat branch of the sewer leads into the territory of the night masks and\nis beyond the scope of this adventure.\n\nTHE SCRAG TRAP.\n\nAlong the sewer the party sees a long plank stretching across the sewer.\nSparkling in the torch light are six pale yellow water worn gems (Irtios\nworth 100 gp each). This is an aquatic troll’s trap. The troll will burst out\nand attack anyone who goes near the gems. If no one goes for the gems,\nonce the party passes it will burst out of the sewer and start climbing up\nonto the passage, roaring dangerously. \n\nLeon will fish a flaming oil jar out of his sack and throw it at it. If he hits\nhe will rush the troll and try to set it ablaze with his torch. \n\nOUT OF THE SEWERS.\n\nIf the party survives this encounter, Leon leads them onward until he\nhears horses clip clopping along the street above. He will find a ladder\nnearby that leads up into an alley. He will then throw his torch into the\nwater and clamber up into the alley.\n\n\n\nHe tells the PCs that today is a festival market day and gives them the\noption of going to the market right now, or going with him to his house to\ncollect their reward and getting cleaned up and then going to the market.\n\nI do not know of a player in existence that will choose not to go to the\nmarket.  \n\nHis house is at 3 Kezzer Street. He reminds the PCs of the evil of this\ncity and not to get into trouble.\n\nBack at his home Leon will have hot soup, bread and beer as well as a\nwarm bath and blankets for all. \n\nThe market is on all day.\n\nTHE MARKET.\n\nThe following are some things the players may see and interact with at\nthe market or about town.\n\n-A lot of food being sold as well as animals, weapons and simple\narmor. Everything is 160 % PHB cost. \n\n    -There is a richly appointed and well guarded specialty cheese stall\nbeing run by a 20th level merchant of incredible skill. The cheeses\navailable are listed in the appendix. \n\n     -Many expensive herbal antidotes and medications are for sale.\n\n-A legal duel to the death has gathered a large betting crowd. The\nfight is between a large bearded man (LE Human Fighter 4) wielding\na broadsword and a skinny rogue type (NE Human Priest of mask 8)\nwho fights with two daggers. The duel is being adjudicated by a city\nCloak (LE Human Wizard 6) and eight soldiers (LE Human Fighter 1,\n2 or 3). Players may bet if they want, and you the DM may conduct\nthe combat. \n\n\n\n-There is dog fight going on, with much onlooking, shouting and\nbetting.\n\n-Cheers come from a side alley and the PCs see an unconscious and\nbloody faced man being dragged out by his friends. This is an illegal\nstreet fighting arrangement, with much betting and prizes for the\nwinner.\n\n-A lovely smell is coming from a pie cart. A pie man is selling dog or\ncat or fish pies for 3 silver each. \n\n-A group of soldiers marching down the street on a daily drill.\n\n-A platinum piece sits on the road. As a PC tries to grab it, it will be\npulled away on a near invisible string. It will be pulled down an alley.\nIf the players follow it into the alley they will discover that a large\nsealed barrel filled with water is falling on them. If they say they\nare looking up or if they make a spot check DC 16 then they will see\nthe kid pushing the barrel and will be allowed a reflex save DC 12 to\nescape being hit by the barrel for 10d4 damage. The barrel will\nexplode drenching everyone within 30 feet and the evil kid will run\naway across the roof tops. The string leads up on to the roof where\nthe kid was. The platinum coin can be grabbed off the street once\nthe kid runs away.\n\n-The PCs take wrong turn down into a dead end alley. At the end of\nthe alley is graffiti proclaiming it to be the turf of the Hard\nDrinking, Fighting Pirates. The PCs will then hear the gang members\ncoming out of hidden doorways and popping up from sewer grates\n(and at the DMs option, whizzing down from the roofs of houses on\nropes). The gang members will form up into an intimidating group\nand start asking the party why they are on their turf, why they are\nso ugly and if they can take a beating. All the gang members are\npretty weak 1st level rogues, thugs or outcasts. Years of debased\nliving has left none of them with more than 6 hit points. But there\nare ten of them. They are each armed with a different weapon.\n\n\n\nThey are: club, rusty rod, knife, dagger, chain, brass knuckles,\nspade, bent short sword, rake and hoe. The gang will scream “No\nretreat! No surrender!” as they charge. They  will run away as soon\nas the battle even slightly turns against them.\n\nIf the players spend all day at the market, they must make their way\nback to Leon’s place in the dark. At night the players will be approached\nby many “ladies of the night”, who wear huge fur coats, and are under the\nwatchful eye of their watchers. \n\nThat is unless your players are under the age of 18 or you believe that\nthis sort of thing should have no place in your game. In which case,\ncompelled by an unseen force, the ladies of the night disappear into the\nshadows before the PCs approach.\n\nTHE NEXT DAY.\n\nLeon will thank the players for their help and arrange to get the players\ntheir items if he was making them something, or he will pay the players\nwhat he owes them. The players may have to wait around to get any\nmasterwork items. \n\nThe adventure ends with the players slumming about in Mulmaster or\nwhichever evil city you set this adventure in. \n\nThis adventure can easily lead into my one:\n\n “Gateway to the Great Evil of the North”.\n\n\n\nAPPENDIX:\n\nPersonalities: \n\nName:     LEON THE LION HEART. \n\nSize:       Med.                 \n\nRace/Sex: Human.\n\nClass/Level: Paladin of Freedom 5 \n\nAlignment: Chaotic Good.  \n\nHit Dice: 5d10 + 20  HP: 60 \n\nInitiative: + 0\n\nSpeed: 30\n\nArmour Class: Touch: 10  Piercing 13  Bludgeoning 15 Slashing 15    \nPossibly more if he uses his defensive blow feat.\n\nAttacks: Broadsword Hack +11 Dam 1d8+7 crit 19-20 X 2\n\nBase Att: +5 \n\nSaves:   Fort : 11  Ref: 4 Will: 7 \n\n Abilities:    Str: 19   Dex: 10  Con: 18   Int: 10  Wis:16  Chr: 16 \n\nSkills:   Armor Check Penalty : 0   Balance : +2  Concentration +6, \nDiplomacy +6,  Jump +5 ,  Knowledge (Nobility) +3, Knowledge (local )+6, \n Heal +5, Spot +6, Sense Motive +6,  Bluff +6, Listen +4, Swim +10\n\nSpells. 1 first Level paladin spell per day.\n\nFeats and Class abilities:\n\n Aura of Good, Detect Evil 60', Smite Evil 2x day, Divine Grace,\n\nLay on hands, Aura of resolve (Immune to compulsion effects.

It is not that he is uncomfortable\non land but he feels deeply powerful when he is on a ship.\n\nAdventures: The pirate gives his life to the sea, he risks his life\nstealing other’s possessions, assaulting small (or big) cities, and\nspending his booty in one night of drinks and women. His only\nfatherland is the sea, his family their companions and his life usually\nends when they are arrested (and probably hanged).\n\nCharacteristics: A pirate lives by assault, so he needs to be a good\nwarrior in order to survive. But he also is a great navigator: no-one can\nbe so skillful, in all the ways, than a pirate on a ship.\n\nAlignment: Their life consists in plundering, assaulting, and murdering,\nso pirates are usually evil. There are neutral or chaotic neutral pirates\nthat are not as bloody as the common ones, although their way of life\nalso requires violence. Although very weird, there are also good\npirates. These ones steal from the rich and usually give the profits to\nthe people who really need that money, they usually don't kill their\ntargets but have a lot of fun laughing at them in many ways. Good\npirates also like adventuring and fighting tyrannical governments and\noppressive laws, although legal good pirates are extremely rare. Legal\n\n\n\npirates are usually privateers (optional rule, see below), and they follow\norders from a kingdom, city, republic, confederation or any other\nsystem of government to do “legal” piracy for its profit.\nReligion: Pirates are not very religious. Those who pray usually worship\ngods of the wind, sea or war.\n\nBackground: Pirates normally come from port cities and from families\nwith very low incomes or oppressed ones, so they learn how to gain his\nlife in the streets since kids, but sooner or later piracy comes into\ntheir lives as the best and funniest way to live.\n\nRaces: Humans tend to like the pirate’s style and are the most common\nrace between them. Half-elves usually find their homes in a ship and\nfeel comfortable between other pirates, where comradeship is more\nimportant than race. Other races can be also found between pirates,\nespecially renegades (such elves that don’t follow traditions or dwarves\ndisliking caves and mines) and evil creatures.\n\nOther classes: Depending of their alignment, pirates get along well\nwith many classes. Chaotic evil pirates like to team up with evil rogues\nand evil sorcerers (better if they know how to control the elements).\nOn the other side, a neutral good pirate can team up with a paladin so\nthey can bring freedom together to the most oppressed countries or villages.\n\nRole: Although a pirate companion can be very useful while adventuring\non land due to his skills and combat abilities, he truly shines when\nsailing on a ship far away from the coast, where no law can stop him.\n\nGAME RULE INFORMATION\nPirates have the following game statistics.\n\nAbilities: Charisma is very important for many of the pirate's special\nabilities, but also for his renown, reputation, self confidence and\n\n\n\nleadership if he wants to be a good captain. Dexterity is important for\nmany skills and for having more success of surviving in a fight, as\npirates can only use light armor. As a combatant class, pirates also\nbenefit from a high Strength and Constitution.\nAlignment: Any (Optional: legal pirates are privateers instead, see above).\nHit Die: d8.\n\nClass Skills\nThe pirate’s class skills (and the key ability for each skill) are Appraise\n(Int), Balance (Dex), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Disguise\n(Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Gather Information (Cha), Hide (Dex),\nIntimidate (Cha), Jump (Str), Knowledge (Geography) (Int), Knowledge\n(Local) (Int) , Listen (Wis), Move Silently (Dex), Profession (Wis),\nSearch (Int), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Spot (Wis),\nSwim (Str), Tumble (Dex) and Use Rope (Dex).\nSkill Points at 1st Level: (6 + Int modifier) x4.\nSkill Points at Each Additional Level: 6 + Int modifier.\n\nClass Features\nAll of the following are class features of the pirate.\n\nWeapon and Armor Proficiency: Pirates are proficient with all simple\nweapons, all light and one-handed martial weapons, plus all firearms\n(only if your DM allows firearms in his campaign. See DMG for more\ndetails). In addition, he is proficient with the cutlass. Pirates are\nproficient with light armor, but not with shields.\n\nSkill Focus (Profession): At 1st level, a pirate receives the feat Skill\nFocus in Profession (Navigator).\nBoarding Charge (Ex): Pirates can use the charge attack while\nbalancing with a rope (or any other object that allows a pendulum-\nmovement). In order to benefit from this ability, the pirate must grasp\nthe rope with one hand and have a weapon in the other. Pirates like\n\n\n\nusing this ability when boarding an enemy ship, although it can be used\nin other situations (such as balancing on hanging lamps, etc).\n\nBonus feat: A 2nd level pirate receives a bonus feat that must be\nchosen from the fighter list, but excluding those available only to\nfighters (such as weapon specialization).\n\nSteel Liver (Ex): Starting at 2nd level, a pirate can swallow massive\namounts of alcoholic drinks. He receives a +4 bonus to fortitude saving\nthrows related to avoid getting drunk or falling unconscious. This bonus\nincreases in +1 every 4 levels after the second.\n\nBravado (Ex): At 4th level a pirate is so confident in himself that he\nreceives an AC bonus equal to his Charisma bonus (if any). This bonus\nto AC applies even against touch attacks or when the pirate is flat-\nfooted. He loses this bonus when he is immobilized or helpless or when\nhe wears any armor other than light. This bonus cannot be higher than\n+1 every four pirate levels.\n\nCannon's Demon: At 5th level, when firing a ship's cannon, a pirate\ndeals an extra 1d6 damage to the target. This damage increases by 1d6\nevery five pirate levels thereafter. (If your DM doesn't allow cannons\nin his campaign, see optional rule below).\n\nPirate With Style (Ex): At 6th level, a pirate must choose a combat\nstyle between the following (the benefits of the pirate's chosen style\napply only when he wears light or no armor. He loses all benefits of his\ncombat style when wearing medium or heavy armor):\n\n−Fencer: He is treated as having the Weapon Finesse feat. \n\n−Defense Master: He is treated as having Uncanny Dodge:\n\n\n\nhe can react to danger before his senses would normally allow him\nto do so. He retains his Dexterity bonus to AC (if any) even if he\nis caught flat-footed or struck by an invisible attacker. However,\nhe still loses his Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized. If a pirate\nalready has uncanny dodge from a different class, he\nautomatically gains improved uncanny dodge instead. \n\n−Gunpowder Addict: When fighting with pistols or other\none-handed firearms, he is treated as having the Precise Shot\nfeat, even if he does not have the normal prerequisites. (If your\nDM doesn't allow firearms in his campaign, see optional rule\nbelow). \n\n−Reckless Fighting: He is treated as having the Two-Weapon\nFighting feat, even if he does not have the normal prerequisites.\n(Pirates usually consider this reckless because not having any\nfree hand while fighting on a ship is rather risky). \n\n−Cutlass' Comrade: When fighting with a cutlass, he is\ntreated as having the Cleave feat, even if he does not have the\nnormal prerequisites.\n\nWit (Ex): At 8th level, the pirate has the ability to think quickly and\naccurately when needed, so he can find solutions in just a moment’s\nthought. He can take 20 in all Knowledge (Geography) and Knowledge\n(Local) checks as a move action, and even while distracted. He also\nreceives a +2 to initiative rolls. \n\nCrew: At 9th level, if the pirate owns a ship and he is the captain, he\nreceives the feat Leadership, but the cohort and followers come as\nloyal crew (at least initially). If he owns no ship and/or is not the\ncaptain he does not gain this benefit until he meets those prerequisites.\n\n\n\nPiracy: On attaining 10th level, and at every two levels thereafter\n(12th, 14th, etc), a pirate gains a special ability of his choice from\namong the following options. He cannot choose the same ability twice:\n\nEvasion (Ex): If a pirate makes a successful Reflex saving throw\nagainst an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save,\nhe instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if a pirate is\nwearing light armor or no armor. A helpless pirate does not gain the\nbenefit of evasion.\n\nDirty Play (Ex): When a pirate fights unarmed or with improvised\nweapons (such as broken bottles, chairs, etc.) he deals an additional\n1d6 damage per successful hit.\n\nPirate With Manners (Ex): His chosen style improves (the benefits of\nthe pirate's chosen improved style apply only when he wears light or no\narmor. He loses all benefits of his combat style when wearing medium\nor heavy armor):\n\n−Fencer: When fighting with finesseable weapons, he is\ntreated as having the Improved Feint feat, even if he does not have\nthe normal prerequisites. \n\n−Defense Master: He is treated as having Improved\nUncanny Dodge: he can no longer be flanked. This defence denies\na rogue the ability to sneak attack the pirate by flanking him,\nunless the attacker has at least four more rogue levels than the\ntarget has pirate levels. If a character already has uncanny\ndodge from a second class, the character automatically gains\nimproved uncanny dodge instead, and the levels from the classes\nthat grant uncanny dodge stack to determine the minimum level a\nrogue must be to flank the character. \n\n\n\n-Gunpowder Addict: He is treated as having the Quick Draw\nfeat. (Pirates with this combat style usually have their belts full\nof pistols). \n\n−Reckless Fighting: He is treated as having the Improved\nTwo-Weapon Fighting feat, even if he does not have the normal\nprerequisites. \n\n-Cutlass' Comrade: When fighting with a cutlass, he is\ntreated as having the Improved Disarm feat, even if he does not\nhave the normal prerequisites.\n\nLooting (Ex): Just with a glance, a pirate can discern the most valuable\nitem in a treasure. If he has success in an Appraise check (DC 15) he\nknows what item has the highest price, although he does not know the\nexact price. He must be able to see the treasure to use this ability.\nUsing this ability requires a standard action; if the item is in within\nreach, he can pick it up(usually throwing it to a sack he holds) as a\nmove action. He can go on rolling each round to know the second most\nvaluable item, third, etc.\nSea Dog: The pirate becomes so certain in the use of certain skills\nwhen he is on a ship that he can use them reliably even under adverse conditions.\nUpon gaining this ability, he selects a number of skills equal to 3 + his\nIntelligence modifier. When making a skill check with one of these\nskills, he may take 10 even if stress and distractions would normally\nprevent him from doing so. He benefits from this ability only when he\nis on a ship.\n\nIntidimidating Gaze (Ex): This ability can be chosen only by a pirate\nwith 12 or more ranks in Intimidate. Intimidating gaze allows the\npirate to use the Intimidate skill just staring at his opponent, without\nneed to talk. Doing it this way, he receives a +2 bonus on his roll. He\n\n\n\nmust be able to have eye contact with the target to use this ability.\n\nScurvy Dog (Su): This ability can be chosen only by a pirate with\nIntimidating Gaze. A Scurvy Dog is continually surrounded by a fearful\naura with a radius of 10 feet. Any creature that enters into the area\nbecomes frightened. If the subject succeeds on a Will save (DC 10 + ½\nthe pirate’s level + the pirate’s Charisma modifier), it is shaken for 1\nround instead. Creatures with 6 or more Hit Dice are immune to this effect.\n\nHoist the Flag! (Su): This ability can be chosen only by a pirate who has\nthe Scurvy Dog ability. If a pirate with Hoist the Flag! is the captain\nof a ship and orders his crew to run up the pirate flag, each creature\nwho sees that flag (excluding the pirate’s allies) becomes panicked\nunless it succeeds on a Will save (DC 10 + ½ the pirate’s level + the\npirate’s Charisma modifier). If cornered, a panicked creature begins\ncowering. If the Will save succeeds, the creature is shaken for 1 round\ninstead.

It has a greenish blue\ntinge to its skin. \n\nThe Jors are a powerful and cunning breed of orcs that live in swamps.\nFrom childhood, they are trained to kill, and many become assassins.\nTheir mind set and society of these humanoids, also known as swamp\norcs, is very similar to that of the more common type of orc. Rumors\n\n\n\nsuggest that jors have formed their own assassins' guild, meant to\ndestroy the more numerous humanoid races over time. Jors and\nlizardfolk are great rivals for swamp territory, with a mutual hatred\nthat often causes them to attack each other on sight. \n\nJors speak Orc and Common. \n\nCOMBAT \nJors are capable of fighting as well as any orc, but make sneak attacks\nwhenever possible. Jors prefer lighter weapons like the scimitar and\ncrossbow, but many commonly carry bastard swords, battleaxes,\nspears, and flails. Like orcs, Jors hate sunlight and only come out of\ntheir lairs after sunset. \n\nJors usually coat their arrows with a potent toxin made from swamp\nplants and waters. \nPoison (Ex): An opponent hit by a Jor’s poisoned weapon must succeed\non a DC 13 Fortitude save or fall unconscious. After 1 minute, the\nsubject must succeed on another DC 13 Fortitude save or remain\nunconscious for 2d6 rounds. A typical jor carries 1d4-1 doses of this\npoison. Jors typically coat both crossbow bolts and melee weapons with\nthis poison. This poison only works once per application, and must be\napplied to the weapon again to be reused. \nPoison Use (Ex): Jor are trained in the use of poison and never risk\naccidentally poisoning themselves when applying poison to a blade. \n\nSneak Attack (Ex): Any time a Jor’s opponent is denied its Dexterity\nbonus to AC, or if a Jor flanks its opponent, it deals an extra 1d6\npoints of damage. This ability is just like the rogue’s sneak attack and\nsubject to the same limitations. If a jor gets a sneak attack bonus\nfrom another source (such as rogue or assassin levels), the bonuses on\ndamage stack. \n\n\n\nLight Sensitivity (Ex): Jors are dazzled in bright sunlight or within the\nradius of a daylight spell. \n\nSkills: The skill modifiers given in the statistics block include a –5\narmor check penalty for wearing scale mail and carrying a light shield. \n\n*A Jor has a +6 racial bonus on Hide, Listen, Move Silently, and Spot\nchecks in any marsh terrain. \n\nJORS AS CHARACTERS \nA jor’s favored class is rogue, and jor leaders tend to be\nrogue/assassins. \n\nJor characters possess the following racial traits. \n\n- +6 Strength, +4 Constitution, -2 Intelligence, -2 Charisma. \n- Medium size. \n- A Jor's base land speed is 30 feet. \n- Darkvision out to 60 feet. \n- Racial Hit Dice: A jor begins with two levels of humanoid, which\nprovide 2d8 Hit Dice, a base attack bonus of +1, and base saving throw\nbonuses of Fort +3, Ref +0, and Will +0. A jor has a +4 racial bonus on\nsaves against poison. \n- Racial Skills: A Jor's humanoid levels give it skill points equal to 5 x\n(2 + Int modifier). Its class skills are Disguise, Hide, and Move Silently.\n*A jor has a +6 racial bonus on Hide, Listen, Move Silently, and Spot\nchecks in any marsh terrain. \n- Racial Feats: A Jor's humanoid levels give it one feat. \n- Special Attacks (see above): Poison Use, Sneak Attack. \n- Special Qualities (see above): Light Sensitivity. \n- Weapon and Armor Proficiency: A jor is proficient with all simple\nweapons and scimitars. It is proficient with light and medium armor\nand with shields (but not tower shields). \n\n\n\n- Automatic Languages: Common, Orc. Bonus Languages: Draconic,\nGiant, Undercommon. \n- Favored Class: Rogue. \n- Level Adjustment +2. \n\n1989 Wizards of the Coast, Inc.

Creatures within the cloud may choose to defend fully and do\nnothing else (that means do nothing but hunch down into a little\ndefending ball) to suffer no effects from the spell. (Constructs are\nunaffected by this spell, as are people in full helmets. The crows\nattack with the casters hit roll using his Int as a modifier vs. the\ntouch AC of all creatures in the cloud. A hit roll blinds the creature\nfor 1d6 rounds and they take 1d4 eye trauma damage. The blindness is\ncumulative. The caster can either move the cloud at 30 feet per round\nwith concentration or he can let it stay where it was summoned. It is\nimpossible to see into or out of the cloud. The cloud is treated as a\nswarm of bats for dispersal purposes.

Mages have tried\nbut to this day none have succeeded. \n\n\n\nNut : 1gp A hardy sharp hard cheese, very favored in the Savage\nFrontier, this cheese is known for the nuts within it. Only the most\nfavored of nuts are used.\n\nPepper : 2gp Much as the north prices its nut cheeses, the lands about\nTethyr have a fond appreciation for its spice cheeses, and best known\nis the pepper cheese. A mixture of cow and goat milk forms this tangy,\nsupple concoction. The leathery rind is dotted w/ peppercorns to give\nthe pepper cheese its own unique flavor.\n\nSuzailian : 3gp A powerful sharp white cheese, flavored with a mild\nwhite wine ornamented with shavings of roasted garlic cloves and\nchunks of onion, slowly basted and roasted in a cinnamon and poppy\nseed oil. It is rumored that people who eat this cheese daily can ward\noff all but the most powerful or starved of vampires . \n\nThavian : 4gp The people of Thay have developed their own concoction,\nin which maple streams are swirled into the liquid cheese form, so as it\nhardens interesting and tasty waves decorate the inner portions of the\ncheese. \n\nTurmish : 6gp A crumbly burgundy cheese made with a heavy red wine.\nWrapped in red wax.\n\nDedicated to Mik for Creating the Legions of Count Legerm and\nrunning the only game that I ever played and was swallowed by\nsurrealistic majesty and kaleidoscopic pageantry at the same time.\n\n \n\n\n"]
